abstract = {We assessed snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus L.) habitat use during winter on two precommercial thinning treatments in sapling stands in northwestern Montana, USA. One treatment type retained 0.2-ha patches of unthinned saplings, representing 8{\%} of the total stand area, and the second retained 0.8-ha patches of unthinned saplings, representing 35{\%} of the stand area. Snowshoe hare habitat use was also estimated within a nearby control sapling stand and mature conifer stands. We used snow tracking and fecal pellet counts to estimate use before and after thinning treatments were applied. Although we did not find a conclusive trend in hare use of sapling stands after thinning, use within the control stand and adjacent mature stands suggested there was considerable movement of hares to nearby untreated stands after thinning. Hares used retention patches regardless of size, even though large retention patches were four times larger than small retention patches. Because hares demonstrated an affinity for dense patches of residual forest, any retention of untreated saplings may be beneficial for hares during winter when applying precommercial thinning treatments in areas where stand sizes are relatively small (10-14 ha), and the resulting thinned matrix is less harsh than in larger thinned stands. Use within thinned portions of the stand and unthinned remnant blocks suggests that over the winter hares may also benefit from a connectivity of dense cover. {\textcopyright} 2005 NRC Canada.},

abstract = {Fire suppression and limited forest management have caused overstocking in many forests across the western United States. Overstocked stands have higher competition for limiting resources and causes tree stress. The amount of stress a tree experiences is related to the current availability of resources (site productivity), and the competition for those resources (stand density). Stressed trees are more susceptible to insects, disease, and mortality, which cause fuel buildup and increase wildfire risk. Pre-commercial thinning (PCT) can alleviate stress by decreasing the amount of competition in younger stands. The objective of this study was to determine how reducing competition through PCT might improve resource availability to trees at a range of initial stand conditions.We used a triplet-plot approach including 4.3 m and 5.5 m spacing and compared those to unthinned controls in stands varying in site productivity (height growth) and density (initial stand basal area) throughout northern Idaho and northeastern Washington. Stands were dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), grand fir (Abies grandis (Douglas ex D. Don) Lindley), and western red cedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don). As expected, higher density stands intercepted greater amounts of light. Thinned stands intercepted 33-58{\%} less light than controls, depending on tree spacing. Site productivity was positively correlated with soil moisture in the spring and soil temperature in both the spring and summer. Pre-commercial thinning increased soil moisture by 6{\%} in the spring and 10{\%} in the summer, and soil temperature increased by 0.5 °C in spring and 1 °C in summer. Douglas-fir foliar N, Ca, Zn concentration decreased after thinning, while P and B increased and S, K, and Cu were unchanged. Thinning had the greatest relative impact on summer soil moisture, followed by soil N availability, and light interception. Thinning response studies frequently focus on light availability; our results demonstrate that the response of soil moisture and nutrient availability exceeded that of light availability for the studied forest types.},

abstract = {We investigated plant community responses (abundance, species diversity, and structural diversity) to a range of precommercial thinning densities in young lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) stands 12 to 14 years after thinning, with both unthinned and old-growth stands for comparison. Abundance of understory plants, especially herbs, appeared to increase dramatically in the thinned stands. The moss layer was significantly more abundant in old-growth stands than in the young pine stands. Of a total of 108 species sampled, only three were introduced species, all of which occurred more frequently in the low-density stands than in any of the other stands. Thinning treatments appeared to increase the abundance of late-seral species. Our results suggest that by disrupting canopy closure, thinning decreased the dominance of tall trees and increased the abundance of herbs, shrubs, and trees in the understory height classes. As a result, thinning to low densities significantly increased the structural richness of the tree layer and caused an increase in total structural diversity, which, although only marginally significant (p = 0.06), was likely biologically important. Our results suggest that thinning will enhance the abundance, species diversity, and structural diversity of the plant community 12 to 14 years postthinning. {\textcopyright} 2006 NRC.},

abstract = {Mounting concerns about global climate change have increased interest in the potential to use common forest management practices, such as forest density management with thinning, in climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. Long-term effects of forest density management on total aboveground C are not well understood, especially for precommercial thinning (PCT) implemented very early in stand development. To assess the climate change mitigation potential of PCT, as well as tradeoffs with climate change adaptation, we examined total aboveground C stores in a 54-year-old western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) precommercial thinning experiment to determine how different PCT treatments affect long-term aboveground C storage and distribution among pools. Four aboveground C pools (live overstory, live understory/mid-story, woody detritus, and forest floor) were measured and separated into C accumulated prior to initiation of the current stand (legacy C) and C accumulated by the current stand (non-legacy C). PCT had no influence on the total non-legacy aboveground C stores 54 years after treatment. Live tree C was nearly identical across densities due to much larger trees in low density treatments. Low density stands had more understory and mid-story C while unthinned plots had significantly more non-legacy woody detritus C than thinned stands. Legacy pools did not vary significantly with density, but made up a substantial proportion of aboveground C stores. We found that: (1) fifty-four years after PCT total aboveground C is similar across treatments, due primarily to the increase in mean tree C of trees grown at lower stand densities; (2) deadwood legacies from the pre-disturbance forest still play an important role in long-term C storage 62 years after current stand initiation, accounting for approximately 20–25{\%} of aboveground C stores; and (3) given enough time since early thinning, there is no trade-off between managing stands to promote individual tree growth and development of understory vegetation, and maximizing stand level accumulation of aboveground C over the long term. We infer that early PCT can be used to simultaneously achieve climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives, provided treatments are implemented early in stand development before canopy closure and the onset of intense intertree competition.},

abstract = {Acceleration of forest succession to develop late-seral structural characteristics in younger stands may be achieved by silvicultural practices such as pre-commercial thinning (PCT). Young second-growth stands of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) range across several million ha of the inland Pacific Northwest of North America and respond positively to various stand treatments. Objectives of this project were that large-scale stand thinning to a wide range of densities, at a 25-year period after PCT, would enhance: (1) productivity and structural features (diameter and height growth, and crown volume and dimensions of crop trees; (2) merchantable volume of crop trees; and (3) development of old-growth structural attributes. Three stands thinned to densities of ∼500 (low), ∼1000 (medium), and ∼2000 (high) stems/ha at age 17. years, with an unthinned young pine and old-growth pine stand for comparison, were located near Penticton in south-central British Columbia. Lodgepole pine grew faster in mean diameter (cm) in the low- (13.89) than either of the medium- (10.2) or high-density (9.2) stands, but mean height growth increment (8.8-9.7m) was similar over the 25-year period since PCT. Mean diameter was 2.2 times greater in the low-density stand than unthinned stand. The medium- and high-density stands also tended to have large diameters (1.7-1.9 times that of the unthinned stand) and crowns, but still with mean heights 5-6m less than trees in the pine component of the old-growth stand. Mean merchantable stand volume (m3/ha) was 1.7-1.9 times higher in the medium- (231) and high-density (257) stands than low-density (137) stand, and comparable to the old-growth pine (225). Mean crown volume (m3) of crop trees was substantially greater in the low- (88) than in the medium- (27) and high-density (31), unthinned (4), or old-growth stands (4 pine only). Mean structural diversity of five layers of coniferous trees was highest in the low- and medium-density stands, with declining diversity from the high-density to unthinned to old-growth stands. In terms of old-growth structural attributes, large dominant trees with substantial crowns, multi-layered canopies of conifers, some canopy gaps, and understory patchiness of herbs and shrubs appeared in the heavily thinned (≤1000stems/ha) stands at 25years post-thinning. These stands were 42years old at this re-measurement, and hence were not considered "old-growth" but the heavily thinned stands seemed to have some old-growth structural attributes. Silvicultural trade-off of stand volume gain vs. old-growth attributes may be necessary for low-density stands.},

abstract = {The fungus Elytroderma deformans causes a serious needle disease of pines in western North America and is considered the most important needle disease of ponderosa pine in Montana. While important, there has been limited evaluation of pre-commercial thinning or other treatments on disease incidence. Our study assessed the efficacy of various silvicultural treatments to reduce impacts from Elytroderma disease within monitoring plots that were established in 2004 and surveyed until 2014. Treatments were randomly assigned through incomplete block design to: (1) thin to 3.7 × 3.7 m spacing; (2) thin to 5.5 × 5.5 m spacing; (3) thin to 3.7 × 3.7 m spacing plus pruning; and (4) control with no thinning or pruning. For assessment, a statistic was developed to represent the average change in Elytroderma presence that occurred from 2006 to 2014 for each plot. This statistic was utilized as the response variable in a model that controlled for initial Elytroderma occurrence within plots to test for treatment effects. Overall, Elytroderma intensified across all plots during the study period and treatments were not effective at preventing new infections. Plots that received the 3.7 m × 3.7 m residual spacing exhibited slightly reduced progression of disease incidence relative to the other treatments. A mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, MPB) eruption occurred during this study. Tree-level MPB and Elytroderma interactions were assessed and no evidence was found to indicate trees infected with Elytroderma had a different likelihood of being attacked by MPB relative to uninfected trees. However, the trees located in plots with high levels of initial Elytroderma disease presence had greater chances of having tree mortality in general, caused by MPB or other factors. MPB did not attack any trees in plots that had the 5.5 × 5.5 m spaced treatment, even where adjacent plots were attacked. Results of this study are presented to inform management of young ponderosa pine forests on impacts of the silvicultural techniques tested on post-treatment Elytroderma dynamics and interactions with MPB-attack.},

We found that periodic annual increment (PAI) of diameter, basal area (BA), volume, and aboveground dry mass were significantly related to stand density index (SDI) and stand age at start of the period; the quadratic trends varied among sites. Precipitation departure from the normal for each period explained a significant amount of residual variation in all PAI variables except diameter. BA production did not change significantly as SDI exceeded 270 trees{\textperiodcentered}ha-1 at the OR sites and 320 trees{\textperiodcentered}ha-1 at the CA site. Stand productivity was the highest at Elliot Ranch (CA) and the least at Blue Mountains (OR). A similar trend held in growth efficiency under lower stand densities (SDI {\textless} 600). Most of the mortality was caused by Dendroctonus bark beetles in stands that exceeded SDI of 500 trees{\textperiodcentered}ha-1. Limiting SDI was about 900 trees{\textperiodcentered}ha-1, although plots at Elliot Ranch reached much higher than that.

Crown length, width, configuration, and volume of this intolerant species were sensitive to stand density -- the heavier the density the smaller the crowns in every dimension. Stem diameters were very sensitive to stand density but growth of crop trees -- was essentially the same when spaceings were wide and sites were not fully occupied. At narrow spacings, intertree competition distributed growth over the entire stand and average tree diameters declined. Height growth of crop trees was about the same on all stand densities except in unthinned stands where it was reduced about 15 percent. Densest stands produced the most basal area and volume but also the most mortality. Phenological timing was little affected by stand densitity.

abstract = {As the forestry landbase shrinks and demand for wood increases, improving productivity of commercial forest stands becomes more important. Because of its commercial value and common occurrence, lodgepole pine is a candidate for productivity improvement. Regenerating lodgepole pine forests are often characterized by very high density and slow growth, limiting their value. Therefore, a variety of precommercial thinning treatments have been tried at long- term installations, which provide valuable data to evaluate projections from existing growth and yield models. In this report, we evaluate the stand growth and yield from different thinning treatments in long-term silviculture installations in the Upper Foothills (Gregg Burn and Teepee Pole Creek) and Lower Foothills (MacKay) subregions of Alberta. The MacKay installation was established in 1954 with the objective of determining whether precommercial thinning of lodgepole pine could improve merchantable volume and quality at a young age, and in turn shorten rotation and increase annual allowable cuts. The Gregg Burn and Teepee Pole Creek installations were established in the 1960s to assess the response of tree and stand growth to different juvenile spacing treatments, with densities ranging from 500 to 8 000 stems per hectare. Tree growth and survival in these installations are measured periodically to evaluate the effect of different intensities of thinning on the growth and yield of the lodgepole pine crop trees. To provide a decadal update to previous measurements and evaluation, published in 2006, we examined total and merchantable volumes in these installations using the most recent data (2011–2014). Our analysis found that thinning is unlikely to increase yields; however, if thinning is carried out for other reasons, judicious choice of a thinning regime can avoid a yield loss. Thinning to 2 000–3 000 stems per hectare appears to be optimal, maximizing the positive effect on tree growth without major losses in volume.},
