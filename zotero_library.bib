  abstract = {Increased forest fire activity across the western continental United States (US) in recent decades has likely been enabled by a number of factors, including the legacy of fire suppression and human settlement, natural climate variability, and human-caused climate change. We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western US forests over the past several decades and, during 2000-2015, contributed to 75\% more forested area experiencing high (\textbackslash textgreater1 {$\sigma$}) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for {$\sim$}55\% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 1984-2015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.},

This study uses 17 climate models to evaluate when changes in fire weather, as realized through the Fire Weather Index, emerge from the expected range of internal variability due to anthropogenic climate change using the time of emergence framework. Anthropogenic increases in extreme Fire Weather Index days emerge for 22\% of burnable land area globally by 2019, including much of the Mediterranean and the Amazon. By the midtwenty-first century, emergence among the different Fire Weather Index metrics occurs for 33\textendash 62\% of burnable lands.

At 2 \textdegree C above preindustrial levels, the area of emergence is half that for 3 \textdegree C. These results highlight increases in fire weather conditions with human-caused climate change and incentivize local adaptation efforts to limit detrimental fire impacts.},

Franco), interior spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss x Picea engelmannii Engelm.), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. Ex Loud. var. latifolia Englem.) in multi-aged stands in central British Columbia, Canada. Background and Objectives: Understanding competitive interactions among tree species in mixed-species stands is fundamental to supporting silvicultural decision-making in such stands. Using the periodic annual basal area increment for single trees as our dependent variable, we investigated whether neighboring trees competed with subject trees independently of species identity. We also examined the differences in single-tree basal area growth among the three conifer species over time under different levels of competition. Materials and Methods:We developed several spatially explicit, single-tree basal area growth models for interior Douglas-fir, interior spruce, and lodgepole pine using data from 16 plots in two blocks of a long-term study (five measurements over a 21-year period) on the response to pre-commercial thinning. We compared these equations to assess whether intraspecific or interspecific competition predominated. We also examined the differences in basal area growth among the three conifer species over time under different levels of competition. Results: We found asymmetrical relationships between the conifer trees and their neighbors for all species, indicating that the main driver limiting growth in these stands is aboveground competition for light. There was evidence of higher intraspecific competition for small (\textbackslash textless10.0 cmDBH) interior Douglas-fir in one block. However, there was no general pattern among larger subject trees with respect to the identity of neighborhood competitive effects and the equivalence of neighbors. We observed a higher level of basal area growth over time for interior Douglas-fir than for lodgepole pine and interior spruce, irrespective of the competition intensity and, not surprisingly, the growth rate declined with increasing competition levels for the three species. Conclusions: Our results provide an understanding of how interior Douglas-fir stands will develop over time and information on species interactions that could help forest managers explore different silvicultural options and their effects on individual tree growth in these complex stands.},

The results show that the best evaluated and recommended for practical use at the level of forest stand was the LOESS function (locally weighted scatterplot smooting) when using a greater width of the bandwidth. Due to the frequent overfitting and the associated unrealistic behaviour of the function, smoothing by spline functions cannot be recommended for modelling the height curve at the level of forest stand. It was validated that the resulting model must be assessed not only according to the calculated quality criteria, but also depending on the graphic pattern of the model which must ensure that the height curve pattern is realistic. The quality of the resulting models (with LOESS function) was assessed to be high, mainly due to the very precise determination of model heights.},

  abstract = {Aim: To understand how tree growth response to regional drought and temperature varies between tree species, elevations and forest types in a mountain landscape. Location: Twenty-one sites on an elevation gradient of 1500 m on the San Francisco Peaks, northern Arizona, USA. Methods: Tree-ring data for the years 1950-2000 for eight tree species (Abies lasiocarpa var. arizonica (Merriam) Lemm., Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm., Pinus aristata Engelm., Pinus edulis Engelm., Pinus flexilis James, Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws., Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco and Quercus gambelii Nutt.) were used to compare sensitivity of radial growth to regional drought and temperature among co-occurring species at the same site, and between sites that differed in elevation and species composition. Results: For Picea engelmannii, Pinus flexilis, Pinus ponderosa and Pseudotsuga menziesii, trees in drier, low-elevation stands generally had greater sensitivity of radial growth to regional drought than trees of the same species in wetter, high-elevation stands. Species low in their elevational range had greater drought sensitivity than co-occurring species high in their elevational range at the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine forest ecotone, ponderosa pine/mixed conifer forest ecotone and high-elevation invaded meadows, but not at the mixed conifer/subalpine forest ecotone. Sensitivity of radial growth to regional drought was greater at drier, low-elevation compared with wetter, high-elevation forests. Yearly growth was positively correlated with measures of regional water availability at all sites, except high-elevation invaded meadows where growth was weakly correlated with all climatic factors. Yearly growth in high-elevation forests up to 3300 m a.s.l.q1 was more strongly correlated with water availability than temperature. Main conclusions: Severe regional drought reduced growth of all dominant tree species over a gradient of precipitation and temperature represented by a 1500-m change in elevation, but response to drought varied between species and stands. Growth was reduced the most in drier, low-elevation forests and in species growing low in their elevational range in ecotones, and the least for trees that had recently invaded high-elevation meadows. Constraints on tree growth from drought and high temperature are important for high-elevation subalpine forests located near the southern-most range of the dominant species. \textcopyright{} 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Successful fire exclusion in the 20th century has created severe fire problems across the West. Not every forest is at risk of uncharacteristically severe wildfire, but drier forests are in need of active management to mitigate fire hazard. We summarize a set of simple principles important to address in fuel reduction treatments: reduction of surface fuels, increasing the height to live crown, decreasing crown density, and retaining large trees of fire-resistant species. Thinning and prescribed fire can be useful tools to achieve these objectives. Low thinning will be more effective than crown or selection thinning, and management of surface fuels will increase the likelihood that the stand will survive a wildfire. Five empirical examples of such treatment are discussed: Hayfork fires, California, 1987; Tyee fire, Washington, 1994; Megram fire, California, 1999; Hayman fire, Colorado, 2002; and the Cone fire, California, 2002. Applying treatments at an appropriate landscape scale will be critical to the success of fuel reduction treatments in reducing wildfire losses in Western forests. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

Moreover, the role it plays in the trait\textendash demography relationship remains unclear. Here, we hypothesize that shade tolerance can be achieved by alternative combinations of traits depending on the species' functional group (evergreen vs. deciduous species) and that its ability to explain the array of traits involved in demography will also vary between these two groups. We used dimension reduction to identify the main trait spectra for 48 tree species, including 23 evergreens and 25 deciduous \textendash{} dispersed across 21 genera and 13 families. We assessed the relationship between functional traits, shade tolerance, and demographic performance at high and low light using structural equation modelling. The dimensions found corresponded to the trait spectra previously observed in the literature and were significantly related to measures of demography. However, our results support the existence of a divergence between evergreen and deciduous species in the way shade tolerance relates to the demography of species along light gradients. We show that shade tolerance can be attained through different combination of traits depending on the functional and geographical context, and thus, its utilization as a predictor of forest dynamics and species coexistence requires previous knowledge on the role it plays in the demographic performance of the species under study.

  abstract = {In the Mediterranean region most climatic forecasts predict longer and more intense drought periods that can affect tree growth and mortality over broad geographic regions. One of the silvicultural treatments that has gained currency to lessen the impacts of climatic change is the reduction of stand density by thinning. However, we lack information on how the response of forest stands to different thinning treatments will be affected by climate change, and on the post-thinning temporal dynamics of water balance, specifically blue and green water. We adopted a modelling approach to explore the long-term effects of different thinning intensities on forest dynamics and water balance under climate change scenarios, coupling an individual-based model of forest dynamics (SORTIE-ND) with a mechanistic model of soil moisture dynamics and plant drought stress. We used as a case study three Scots pine plots across a gradient of climatic conditions, and we assessed the effect of site, three climatic scenarios and eight thinning intensities on tree growth, stand productivity, tree drought stress and blue water. The best thinning intensity in terms of stand productivity was obtained when between 20 and 40\% of the basal area was removed, whereas the final stand stock rapidly decreased at higher thinning intensities. Moreover, the decrease in final basal area occurred at lower thinning intensities the drier the site conditions. Moderate and heavy thinnings (\textbackslash textgreater30\%) doubled basal area increment (BAI) of the following years in all the plots, although the effect vanished after 30\textendash 40 years, independently of the site and climate scenario. As expected, thinning was simulated to have an overall positive effect on the blue water yield and tree water status, which increased and also tended to last longer for higher thinning intensities. However, the magnitude of this effect on tree water status was most dependent on the site and climatic scenario, as drier conditions generally raised stronger and longer lasting reductions in drought stress for a given thinning intensity. Furthermore, our results highlight the existence of a site- and climate-dependent trade-off between the gain in stand productivity and the improvement in tree water status obtained by thinning, particularly for moderate or heavy thinning intensities. Our simulations suggest that thinning is a useful management tool to mitigate climate change but strongly argue against the application of general recipes across sites and appeals for carefully taking into consideration local climatic trajectories for management planning.},

In applying the site index concept, one typically assumes that height development is not affected by stand density or thinning treatment. This assumption has been challenged by recent studies on loblolly pine. A detailed data set with initial densities ranging from 6,730 to 750 trees/ha and covering ages 1 through 25 after plantation establishment was used to study and model the effect of initial spacing on height development of loblolly pine. Dominant height was found to be dependent on initial spacing. Height-age models are proposed that take into account the effect of spacing on average and dominant height. The differences among plantation densities are evident from age 6 and are consistent to the end of the 25-year period of study. Previous studies in other conifers have reported an early advantage in terms of height growth in denser stands that tend to disappear with age, producing a crossover of the growth trajectories. No evidence of this crossover effect in height was found. \textcopyright{} 2011 by the Society of American Foresters.},

To date, a global-scale understanding of fire is largely limited to the annual extent of burning as detected by satellites. This is problematic becausefireismultidimensional, and focusona single metric belies its complexity and importance within the Earth system. To address this, we identified five key characteristics of fire regimes- size, frequency, intensity, season, and extent-and combined new and existing global datasets to represent each. We assessed how these global fire regime characteristics are related to patterns of climate, vegetation (biomes), and human activity. Cross-correlations demonstrate that only certain combinations of fire characteristics are possible, reflecting fundamental constraints in the types of fire regimes that can exist. A Bayesian clustering algorithm identified five global syndromes of fire regimes, or pyromes. Four pyromes represent distinctions between crown, litter, and grass-fueled fires, and the relationship of these to biomes and climate are not deterministic. Pyromes were partially discriminated on the basis of available moisture and rainfall seasonality. Human impacts also affected pyromes and are globally apparent as the driver of afifth and unique pyrome that represents human-engineered modifications to fire characteristics. Differing biomes and climates may be represented within the same pyrome, implying that pathways of change in future fire regimes in response to changes in climate and human activity may be difficult to predict.},

  abstract = {Roughly 3\% of the Earth's land surface burns annually, representing a critical exchange of energy and matter between the land and atmosphere via combustion. Fires range from slow smouldering peat fires, to low-intensity surface fires, to intense crown fires, depending on vegetation structure, fuel moisture, prevailing climate, and weather conditions. While the links between biogeochemistry, climate and fire are widely studied within Earth system science, these relationships are also mediated by fuels-namely plants and their litter-that are the product of evolutionary and ecological processes. Fire is a powerful selective force and, over their evolutionary history, plants have evolved traits that both tolerate and promote fire numerous times and across diverse clades. Here we outline a conceptual framework of how plant traits determine the flammability of ecosystems and interact with climate and weather to influence fire regimes. We explore how these evolutionary and ecological processes scale to impact biogeochemical and Earth system processes. Finally, we outline several research challenges that, when resolved, will improve our understanding of the role of plant evolution in mediating the fire feedbacks driving Earth system processes. Understanding current patterns of fire and vegetation, as well as patterns of fire over geological time, requires research that incorporates evolutionary biology, ecology, biogeography, and the biogeosciences.},

Light energy (400\textendash 750 nm) was recorded periodically on clear days in June and July at 48 points under four mixed conifer stands and segregated into four spectral bands (blue, 400\textendash 450; green, 500\textendash 550; red, 650\textendash 700; far-red, 700\textendash 750 nm). Minor changes in the proportion of light in one band to that in another occur throughout the day, but in general the 400- to 700-nm range appears rather uniformly absorbed by a coniferous forest canopy. Averaged for an entire day, only the far-red band showed a significant proportional increase under a coniferous canopy compared to unfiltered sunlight.The relation between the energy received in each of the spectral bands and the total recorded in the 400- to 700-nm range was linear. The sampled canopies transmitted up to 25\% of full sunlight. Beneath the canopies, the ratio of blue to total energy (400\textendash 700 nm) was 0.1540. Green, red, and far-red had ratios of 0.1853, 0.1220, and 0.1207.Terminal growth of 34 seedlings was measured at the light-sampling points to provide a means of establishing lower limits of light energy for survival. The lower limit for Abies and Pseudotsuga was 1.85 langleys (ly) per day (400\textendash 700 nm). Pinus grew only where the light energy exceeded 36.8 ly/day.An interaction with moisture appears to influence the minimum requirements for light energy of a species. Where moisture was adequate throughout the growing season, the lower limit of light for Pseudotsuga seedling establishment was 1.85 ly/day; where moisture became limiting, the minimum light requirement increased to 6.64 ly/day.}

We identified factors that influence the fall rates of lodgepole pines, Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud., killed by bark beetles during a severe regional-scale outbreak of mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, that occurred in 2004\textendash 2012. Data were obtained during annual assessments (2010\textendash 2019) of a network of 107 0.081-ha circular plots installed in P. contorta forests in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Utah and Wyoming, U.S. A total of 3789 P. contorta snags were monitored, and in each case we recorded, among other variables, the year the snag was created and the year the snag fell to the forest floor. Among snag age classes (i.e., number of years since tree death), the highest number of snags (1046) were 12 years since death (YSD), and those 13 and 14 YSD exhibited the lowest fall rates to date (\textbackslash textless10\%) despite being the oldest in our study. Snags 13 and 14 YSD were among the largest in diameter. Snag fall occurred in every snag age class from 1 to 14 YSD, with the greatest proportion of snag fall events occurring 4\textendash 8 YSD. By 2019, 24.7\% (937) of snags fell to the forest floor. We modeled snag fall using a Cox's proportional-hazards model that included six covariates of interest: elevation (m), slope aspect (categorical, cardinal direction), slope (\%), canopy cover (\%), snag height (m), and snag height:dbh (m, diameter at 1.37 m in height). Slope aspect had the strongest influence on fall rates. Northern aspects, increased canopy cover, and taller snag heights decreased the probability of snag fall. Conversely, southern aspects and increased height:dbh ratios (i.e., taller, skinner snags) increased the probability of snag fall. The predicted half-life (i.e., the amount of time since death required for 50\% of the snag population to fall to the forest floor) was {$\sim$}16 YSD after which the function predicted a linear, {$\sim$}0.04/year decline in snag survival probability 15\textendash 30 YSD. The observed longevity of P. contorta snags confers important ecological benefits for some wildlife, and may offer opportunities for extended periods of salvage. However, checking (cracks) rapidly occurred, and many snags 6 YSD and older had at least one check at 1.37 m and 5.5 m in height, which can negatively impact lumber recovery. The relatively slow snag fall rates observed in our study also lengthen concerns regarding hazard trees, human safety, and protection of critical infrastructure. The implications of these and other results to management of P. contorta forests are discussed.},

One treatment type retained 0.2-ha patches of unthinned saplings, representing 8\% of the total stand area, and the second retained 0.8-ha patches of unthinned saplings, representing 35\% of the stand area. Snowshoe hare habitat use was also estimated within a nearby control sapling stand and mature conifer stands. We used snow tracking and fecal pellet counts to estimate use before and after thinning treatments were applied. Although we did not find a conclusive trend in hare use of sapling stands after thinning, use within the control stand and adjacent mature stands suggested there was considerable movement of hares to nearby untreated stands after thinning. Hares used retention patches regardless of size, even though large retention patches were four times larger than small retention patches. Because hares demonstrated an affinity for dense patches of residual forest, any retention of untreated saplings may be beneficial for hares during winter when applying precommercial thinning treatments in areas where stand sizes are relatively small (10-14 ha), and the resulting thinned matrix is less harsh than in larger thinned stands. Use within thinned portions of the stand and unthinned remnant blocks suggests that over the winter hares may also benefit from a connectivity of dense cover. \textcopyright{} 2005 NRC Canada.},

  abstract = {The Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) growth and yield model is widely used throughout the United States, but recent studies have reported unexpectedly large bias for some regional model variants. Here we propose a general framework for model evaluation, designed to highlight model strengths and weaknesses and inform calibration efforts. We apply the framework to evaluate the Lodgepole Pine (LP) model of the FVS Central Rockies Variant (FVS-CR), which has rarely been evaluated in the literature despite its widespread use in the western US. We started with a qualitative verification of the structure and logic of the FVS-CR LP model against a modified Bakuzis matrix, determining that it adequately reproduces known patterns of stand dynamics. We then compared stand-level growth simulations to a chronosequence developed from 554 Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots measured in Colorado and Wyoming lodgepole pine forests. This quantitative validation exercise revealed that the default model settings substantially over-predict basal area and total stand carbon after 50 years for both pure lodgepole pine stands and mixed lodgepole pine stands containing a minor proportion of Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and quaking aspen. Using equivalence testing to validate the large-tree diameter increment model against a separate dataset of 3,790 remeasured trees on 124 lodgepole pine FIA plots, we found that the default FVS\textendash CR LP model adequately predicts lodgepole diameter growth, though we observed large variation in model errors. Equivalence tests also revealed systematic under-estimation of spruce\textendash fir and over-estimation of aspen productivity. Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to identify the most important model parameters and data inputs driving simulated stand structure and carbon accumulation in both the short- (50 years) and long-term (200 years). The model shows the greatest sensitivity to initial species composition; a small proportion of aspen, spruce, or fir seedlings led to long-term stand re-structuring and greatly increased carbon accumulation. Other sensitive parameters included site index, the fixed large-tree diameter increment adjustment factor, and the parameter controlling the point at which density-dependent self-thinning begins (maximum stand density index). This evaluation leads us to conclude that the FVS-CR LP model tends to under-estimate tree mortality (particularly in young stands) and the default site index represents relatively high productivity stands, such that re-calibration may often be necessary to capture realistic long-term stand behaviors. Our sensitivity analysis provides guidance for future efforts to re-calibrate the FVS-CR LP model and highlights the importance of collecting site index and seedling species composition data wherever possible to produce the most realistic simulations.},

Although climate change has likely enabled a portion of the increase in wildfire activity, the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We evaluate over 1.5 million government records of wildfires that had to be extinguished or managed by state or federal agencies from 1992 to 2012, and examined geographic and seasonal extents of human-ignited wildfires relative to lightningignited wildfires. Humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal "fire niche" in the coterminous United States, accounting for 84\% of all wildfires and 44\% of total area burned. During the 21-y time period, the human-caused fire season was three times longer than the lightning-caused fire season and added an average of 40,000 wildfires per year across the United States. Human-started wildfires disproportionally occurredwhere fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Human-started wildfires were dominant (\textbackslash textless80\% of ignitions) in over 5.1 million km2, the vast majority of the United States, whereas lightning-started fires were dominant in only 0.7 million km2, primarily in sparsely populated areas of the mountainous western United States. Ignitions caused by human activities are a substantial driver of overall fire risk to ecosystems and economies. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards.},

We analyzed heat effects on xylem hydraulics both in the laboratory and at a forest site hit by fire. Stem vulnerability to drought-induced embolism and hydraulic conductivity were measured in Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris and Fagus sylvatica. Control branches were compared with samples experimentally exposed to 90\textdegree C or damaged by a natural forest fire. In addition, xylem anatomical changes were examined microscopically. Experimental heating caused structural changes in the xylem and increased vulnerability in all species. The largest shifts in vulnerability thresholds (1.3 MPa) were observed in P. sylvestris. F. sylvatica also showed heat-induced reductions (49\%) in hydraulic conductivity. At the field site, increased vulnerability was observed in damaged branches of P. sylvestris and F. sylvatica, and the xylem of F. sylvatica was 39\% less conductive in damaged than in undamaged branches. These results provide evidence for heat-induced impairment of tree hydraulics after fire. The effects recorded at the forest fire site corresponded to those obtained in laboratory experiments, and revealed pronounced hydraulic risks in P. sylvestris and F. sylvatica. Knowledge of species-specific hydraulic impairments induced by fire and heat is a prerequisite for accurate estimation of post-fire mortality risks.},

A key challenge in improving the accuracy of these predictions is selecting appropriate wind and fuel moisture inputs. Our objective was to evaluate postfire mortality predictions using the Forest Vegetation Simulator Fire and Fuels Extension (FVS-FFE) to determine if using representative fire-weather data would improve prediction accuracy over two default weather scenarios. We used pre- and post-fire measurements from 342 stands on forest inventory plots, representing a wide range of vegetation types affected by wildfire in California, Oregon, andWashington. Our representative weather scenarios were created by using data from local weather stations for the time each stand was believed to have burned. The accuracy of predicted mortality (percent basal area) with different weather scenarios was evaluated for all stands, by forest type group, and by major tree species using mean error, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). One of the representative weather scenarios, MeanWind, had the lowest mean error (4\%) in predicted mortality, but performed poorly in some forest types, which contributed to a relatively high RMSE of 48\% across all stands. Driven in large part by over-prediction of modelled flame length on steeper slopes, the greatest over-prediction mortality errors arose in the scenarios with higher winds and lower fuel moisture. Our results also indicated that fuel moisture was a stronger influence on post-fire mortality than wind speed. Our results suggest that using representative weather can improve accuracy of mortality predictions when attempting to model over a wide range of forest types. Focusing simulations exclusively on extreme conditions, especially with regard to wind speed, may lead to over-prediction of tree mortality from fire.},

In a subalpine forest landscape in northwestern Colorado, we quantified spatial associations of fire and spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) outbreaks over more than a century and developed a multivariate logistic model of probability of occurrence of spruce beetle outbreaks. The study area, an {$\sim$}2800 km2 landscape in White River National Forest, was affected by severe widespread fires around 1879 and by a spruce beetle outbreak in the 1940s, which affected most of the forests that were dominated by Picea engelmannii (Engelmann spruce) and Abies lasiocarpa (subalpine fir). The boundaries of the fires ca. 1879 and of the 1940s spruce beetle outbreaks were digitized based on an 1898 vegetation map and modern aerial photograph interpretation, and overlaid in a Geographic Information System. The areas disturbed by the ca. 1879 fires and the 1940s beetle outbreak were also overlaid with 303 fires recorded after 1950 as well as with topographic and forest structural variables. Forests that had burned in 1879 were less affected by the 1940s outbreak than older stands. On the other hand, areas affected by the 1940s spruce beetle outbreak showed no higher susceptibility to subsequent fires. A multivariate logistic model indicated that, although fire history had the greatest effect on stand susceptibility to spruce beetle outbreak, dominance of neighboring stands by spruce as well as elevation were also important predictors of outbreaks. Predictive modeling of spatial interactions between fire and spruce beetle disturbances needs to consider the high degree of variability in the nature of these interactions related to contingencies Such as time since last major disturbance, topographic position, and weather during windows of potential interaction.},

These modest population growth rates are the consequence of their life-history characteristics. Characteristics such as the age at which females start reproducing, the number of years between births, and how many years a female will live and reproduce, determine how quickly a population can increase. Most marine mammal species take many years to reach sexual maturity and have long gestation periods that result in the production of, at most, only one young a year. In fact, most species give birth only once every several years. Even when annual rates of survival are very high, these characteristics cause populations to grow slowly. Low rates of population growth make most species of marine mammal vulnerable to overexploitation, as shown by the rapid depletion of many whale populations by commercial whaling.}

  abstract = {Disturbances such as fire, insect outbreaks, and blowdown are important in shaping subalpine forests in the Rocky Mountains, but quantitative studies of their interactions are rare. We investigated the combined effects of past disturbances, current vegetation, and topography on spatial variability of the severity of a fire that burned approximately 4500 ha of subalpine forest during the extreme drought of 2002 in northwestern Colorado. Ordinal logistic regression was used to spatially model fire severity in relation to late 1800s fires, a 1940s spruce beetle outbreak, forest cover type, stand structure, and topography. The late 1800s fires reduced the probability of burning in 2002, and the 1940s beetle outbreak slightly increased the probability of fire, particularly at high severity. Aspen (Populus tremuloides) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands, which established after the late 1800s fires, were less likely to burn, whereas Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii)-subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) stands were more likely to burn. The highest elevations ({$\geq$}3100 m) had the lowest probability of burning, whereas intermediate elevations (2900-3100 m) had an increased probability of burning at high severity. The influences of the late 1800s fires and 1940s beetle outbreak on stand structure and forest cover type may be more important than their direct effects on fuels. The most important predictors determining fire severity were stand structure, forest cover type, the late 1800s fires, and elevation. Although, in other studies, the effects of pre-burn stand conditions and topography declined with increasingly severe fire weather, in the case of the 2002 fire in Colorado, these predictors explained 42\% of the variability of fire severity. Thus, these results suggest that pre-burn stand conditions are important influences on burn severity even for fires burning during extreme drought. \textcopyright{} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Fire has been burning ecosystems for hundreds of millions of years, helping to shape global biome distribution and to maintain the structure and function of fire-prone communities. Fire is also a significant evolutionary force, and is one of the first tools that humans used to re-shape their world. Here, we review the recent literature, drawing parallels between fire and herbivores as alternative consumers of vegetation. We point to the common questions, and some surprisingly different answers, that emerge from viewing fire as a globally significant consumer that is analogous to herbivory. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Forest insect outbreaks can impose significant tree mortality across vast forested landscapes. The current epidemic of mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, for example, has led to the mortality of pine trees in western Canada and the U.S. spanning tens of millions of hectares. The ecological processes driving mountain pine beetle outbreaks are governed by multiple feedback mechanisms, thresholds, and external constraints that exist along a spatial continuum from individual insect-tree interactions to landscape level change. These components of mountain pine beetle epidemics need to be explicitly parameterized in modeling efforts that aim to predict where insect disturbance will occur in a forest each year and the amount of tree mortality that will ensue as a result. However, do date, minimal efforts exist that examine how local level interactions between beetles and trees translate into broader patterns of tree mortality, and those that do are limited to relatively local scales. In this study, we present an agent-based model that simulates how tree mortality results from the combination of beetle-tree interactions, beetle-to-beetle communication, tree defense to beetle attack, beetle density dynamics, host tree availability, dispersal behavior, and landscape heterogeneity. Our model is tested using data from an area in central British Columbia, Canada, that is near the center of the current outbreak in that region. The model simulates both overall tree mortality and spatial patterns of tree mortality, producing results that are similar to those observed in aerial surveys of tree health. Moving forward, the computational efficiency of our model demonstrates the capability to be applied to large, regional landscapes when implemented with sufficient computing resources. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Global climate change has led to an increase in large-scale bark beetle outbreaks in forests around the world, resulting in significant impacts to forest ecosystems, timber economies, and forest-dependent communities. As such, prediction models that utilize temperature for estimating future bark beetle locations and consequential tree mortality are critical for informing forest management decision-making in an attempt to mitigate and adapt to pending and current outbreaks. This is especially true for physiological models that account for the effects of overwinter temperatures on bark beetle survival, as seasonal temperatures, specifically during winter months, exert the greatest impact on bark beetle mortality during various stages of life cycle development. Yet, how temperature observations are used to predict bark beetle survival can significantly under- or over-estimate the role that temperature variability plays in annual tree mortality, especially under current climate change trajectories. This study evaluates how representations of winter temperature influence bark beetle survival estimates. Using the recent outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) across the western USA as a case study, single-year to decade-long winter temperature averages were used as inputs into a physiological beetle survival prediction model, the results of which were compared against beetle-induced tree mortality observations using temporal autoregressive models. Results show that using longer-term survival averages of seven to ten years significantly increases the likelihood that temperature alone can predict general levels of beetle survival and hence beetle-induced mortality. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering the role of long-term temperature observations when forecasting bark beetle outbreaks, and that year-to-year temperature variability may be constrained in predicting beetle survival during outbreak periods.},

Host defenses were major constraints when mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) populations were low, but inconsequential after stand-level densities surpassed a critical threshold. We annually examined all lodgepole pines (Pinus contorta Douglas var. latifolia) in six 12-18 ha stands for 3-6 years for beetle attack and establishment as beetle densities progressed through various population phases. We also assayed a suite of tree physiological and chemical attributes and related them to subsequent attacks during that year. Rapidly inducible defenses appeared more important than constitutive defenses, and total monoterpenes were more important than particular constituents. Trees that exude more resin and accumulate higher monoterpene concentrations in response to simulated attack largely escaped natural attacks when populations were low. In stands where beetles had reached incipient densities, these defenses were ineffective. Larger diameter trees had more pronounced defenses than smaller diameter trees. As populations increased, beetles selected increasingly larger, m ore resource-rich trees, despitetheir better defenses. When populations were too low for cooperative attack, beetles exploited trees weakened by lower-stem insects. Behavioral plasticity allows beetles to persist at endemic levels until conditions shift, after which positive feedbacks predominate.}

  abstract = {Humans and their ancestors are unique in being a fire-making species, but 'natural' (i.e. independent of humans) fires have an ancient, geological history on Earth. Natural fires have influenced biological evolution and global biogeochemical cycles, making fire integral to the functioning of some biomes. Globally, debate rages about the impact on ecosystems of prehistoric human-set fires, with views ranging from catastrophic to negligible. Understanding of the diversity of human fire regimes on Earth in the past, present and future remains rudimentary. It remains uncertain how humans have caused a departure from 'natural' background levels that vary with climate change. Available evidence shows that modern humans can increase or decrease background levels of natural fire activity by clearing forests, promoting grazing, dispersing plants, altering ignition patterns and actively suppressing fires, thereby causing substantial ecosystem changes and loss of biodiversity. Some of these contemporary fire regimes cause substantial economic disruptions owing to the destruction of infrastructure, degradation of ecosystem services, loss of life, and smoke-related health effects. These episodic disasters help frame negative public attitudes towards landscape fires, despite the need for burning to sustain some ecosystems. Greenhouse gas-induced warming and changes in the hydrological cycle may increase the occurrence of large, severe fires, with potentially significant feedbacks to the Earth system. Improved understanding of human fire regimes demands: (1) better data on past and current human influences on fire regimes to enable global comparative analyses, (2) a greater understanding of different cultural traditions of landscape burning and their positive and negative social, economic and ecological effects, and (3) more realistic representations of anthropogenic fire in global vegetation and climate change models. We provide an historical framework to promote understanding of the development and diversification of fire regimes, covering the pre-human period, human domestication of fire, and the subsequent transition from subsistence agriculture to industrial economies. All of these phases still occur on Earth, providing opportunities for comparative research. \textcopyright{} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

We used individual-tree growth data from permanent sample plots on 83 sites in Switzerland representing a three-species mixture between Norway spruce, Silver fir, and European beech. Basal area growth models for all three species indicated significant interactions between a competition index (CIs) and species composition in the neighborhood. The spatially-explicit CIs indicates stand density within a 10-m radius neighborhood, and the contribution of individual species to the CIs indicates the species composition. Given the rich vertical stand structure in the sample plots, which were often managed by single-tree selection cutting, it is not surprising that interactions between CIs and species proportion varied with relative tree height. We used the individual tree growth models to simulate stand growth with and without species composition effects. A sample plot with its real stand structure in terms of tree size and position was homogenized in terms of species composition at the tree level. By varying the stand density of this plot, we demonstrate how overyielding increases with stand density. In the given mixture, it is mostly beech contributing to the observed overyielding in dense mixed stands. Stand density therefore needs to be considered more explicitly when studying growth and yield of mixed species stands.},

  abstract = {Disturbances are fundamental components of ecosystems and, in many cases, a dominant driver of ecosystem structure and function at multiple spatial and temporal scales. While the effect of any one disturbance may be relatively well understood, multiple interacting disturbances can cause unexpected disturbance behavior (e.g., larger extents), altered return likelihoods, or reduced ecosystem resilience and regime shifts. Given the long-lasting implications of such events, and the potential for changes in disturbance rates driven by climate change and increasing anthropogenic pressures, developing a broad conceptual understanding and some predictive ability regarding the likelihood of interactions between disturbances is crucial. Through a broad synthesis of the literature, and across multiple biomes, disturbance interactions are placed into a unified framework around the concept of changing ecosystem resistance ("linked interactions," alterations to likelihood, extent, or severity) or ecosystem resilience ("compound interactions," alterations to recovery time or trajectory). Understanding and predicting disturbance interactions requires disaggregating disturbances into their constituent legacies, identifying the mechanisms which drive disturbances behavior (or ecosystem recovery), and determining when and where those mechanisms might be altered by the legacies of prior disturbances. The potential for cascading effects is discussed, by which these interactions may extend the reach of anthropogenic or climate change-induced alterations to disturbances beyond what is currently anticipated. Finally, several avenues for future research are outlined, as suggested from the current literature (and areas in which that literature is lacking). These include the potential for cross-scale interactions and changing scale-driven limitations, further work on cascading effects, and the potential for cross-biome comparisons. Disturbance interactions have the potential to cause large, nonlinear, or unexpected changes in ecosystem structure and functioning; finding generality across these complex events is an important step in predicting their occurrence and understanding their significance.},

High probabilities of root disease were found for stands in the western hemlock Tsuga heterophylla and grand fir Abies grandis habitat type series (0.59) and in other habitat types on moderate slopes with southerly aspects (0.48). Low probabilities of disease were found on non-hemlock and non grand fir types on northerly aspects (0.15) and southerly aspects that were on either flat or very rugged terrain (0.17). Both Phellinus weirii and Armillaria sp., probably A. ostoyae, were frequently associated with mortality in hemlock, grand fir, and cedar Thuja habitat type series.

Five biparametric nonlinear equations were fitted and evaluated based on a data set consisting of 8614 trees from 455 plots located in the four most important regions where the species occurs in Spain. Because of the problem of high correlation among observations taken from the same sampling unit, a mixed-model approach, including random coefficients, is proposed. Several stand variables, such as density, dominant height, or diametric distribution percentiles, were included in the model as covariates to explain among plot variability. To determine interregional variability among the regions studied, regional effects were included in the model using fixed dummy variables. Two models, one for inland regions and one for coastal regions, were found to be sufficient to explain regional variability in the height-diameter relationship for the species in Spain. Mixed models allow predictive role in two ways: a typical response, including only fixed effects, and a calibrated response, where random effects are predicted and included in the model from the prior measurement of the height in a subsample of trees. Different alternatives were tested to determine optimum subsample size. Measurement of the height of the 20\% largest trees in the plot has been shown to be a useful approach.}

The frequency of extreme wildfire weather will increase with continued warming, but many uncertainties still exist about future fire regimes, including how the risk of large fires will persist as vegetation changes. Past fire-climate relationships provide an opportunity to constrain the related uncertainties, and reveal widespread burning across large regions of western North America during past warm intervals. Whether such episodes also burned large portions of individual landscapes has been difficult to determine, however, because uncertainties with the ages of past fires and limited spatial resolution often prohibit specific estimates of past area burned. Accounting for these challenges in a subalpine landscape in Colorado, we estimated century-scale fire synchroneity across 12 lakesediment charcoal records spanning the past 2,000 y. The percentage of sites burned only deviated from the historic range of variability during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) between 1,200 and 850 y B.P., when temperatures were similar to recent decades. Between 1,130 and 1,030 y B.P., 83\% (median estimate) of our sites burned when temperatures increased {$\sim$}0.5 \textdegree C relative to the preceding centuries. Lake-based fire rotation during the MCA decreased to an estimated 120 y, representing a 260\% higher rate of burning than during the period of dendroecological sampling (360 to -60 y B.P.). Increased burning, however, did not persist throughout the MCA. Burning declined abruptly before temperatures cooled, indicating possible fuel limitations to continued burning.},

  abstract = {The relative importance of competition and facilitation has been hypothesized to change with variation in abiotic conditions. I examined the relative importance of competition and facilitation along elevation gradients in the northern Rocky Mountains where Pinus albicaulis and Abies lasiocarpa dominate the overstory. At lower elevations and in more sheltered sites, A. lasiocarpa seedlings, saplings, and trees were not spatially associated with mature P. albicaulis, whereas at high-elevation sites along exposed ridges near timberline A. lasiocarpa were highly aggregated around mature P. albicaulis. I also compared growth rates of A. lasiocarpa trees before and after the death of adjacent P. albicaulis to growth rates of A. lasiocarpa in the same years but adjacent to living trees. In the Bitterroot Mts. A. lasiocarpa responded positively to the death of adjacent P. albicaulis at low-elevation sites (7\% increase), but negatively at high-elevation sites (24\% decrease). This suggests that facilitation was more important at timberline sites characterized by abiotic extremes and competition was more important in more moderate abiotic conditions. At high-elevation sites in both mountain ranges, large A. lasiocarpa were 2-4 times more aggregated with P. albicaulis than A. lasiocarpa seedlings. At the high-elevation site in the Bitterroots, growth rates of large A. lasiocarpa were significantly lower in open microsites than when trees were adjacent to either living or dead P. albicaulis. In contrast, growth rates of small saplings did not differ among these microsites. Stronger facilitative effects on mature trees than on seedlings or saplings may develop because the winter snowpack protects small A. lasiocarpa from blowing ice and snow. After trees grow above the snowpack shelter from large P. albicaulis may be crucial. These results emphasize the importance of studying interspecific interactions over a range of conditions; in these forests both positive and negative interactions occur between A. lasiocarpa and P. albicaulis, but their relative importance depends on abiotic conditions and plant life history stage.}

  abstract = {We use permanent-plot data from the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program for an analysis of the effects of competition on tree growth along environmental gradients for the 14 most abundant tree species in forests of northern New England, USA. Our analysis estimates actual growth for each individual tree of a given species as a function of average potential diameter growth modified by three sets of scalars that quantify the effects on growth of (1) initial target tree size (dbh), (2) local environmental conditions, and (3) crowding by neighboring trees. Potential growth of seven of the 14 species varied along at least one of the two environmental axes identified by an ordination of relative abundance of species in plots. The relative abundances of a number of species were significantly displaced from sites where they showed maximum potential growth. In all of these cases, abundance was displaced to the more resource-poor end of the environmental gradient (either low fertility or low moisture). The pattern was most pronounced among early successional species, whereas late-successional species reached their greatest abundance on sites where they also showed the highest growth in the absence of competition. The analysis also provides empirical estimates of the strength of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects of neighbors. For all but one of the species, our results led us to reject the hypothesis that all species of competitors have equivalent effects on a target species. Most of the individual pairwise interactions were strongly asymmetric. There was a clear competitive hierarchy among the four most shade-tolerant species, and a separate competitive hierarchy among the shade-intolerant species. Our results suggest that timber yield following selective logging will vary dramatically depending on the configuration of the residual canopy, because of interspecific variation in the magnitude of both the competitive effects of different species of neighbors and the competitive responses of different species of target trees to neighbors. The matrix of competition coefficients suggests that there may be clear benefits in managing for specific mixtures of species within local neighborhoods within stands. \textcopyright{} 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Broad-scale assessments of vegetation responses to drought are needed to anticipate, manage, and potentially mitigate climate-change effects on ecosystems. We quantified the drought sensitivity of vegetation in the Pacific Northwest, USA, as the percent reduction in vegetation greenness under droughts relative to baseline moisture conditions. At a regional scale, shrub-steppe ecosystems\textemdash with drier climates and lower biomass\textemdash showed greater drought sensitivity than conifer forests. However, variability in drought sensitivity was considerable within biomes and within ecosystems and was mediated by landscape topography, climate, and soil characteristics. Drought sensitivity was generally greater in areas with higher elevation, drier climate, and greater soil bulk density. Ecosystems with high drought sensitivity included dry forests along ecotones to shrublands, Rocky Mountain subalpine forests, and cold upland sagebrush communities. In forests, valley bottoms and areas with low soil bulk density and high soil available water capacity showed reduced drought sensitivity, suggesting their potential as drought refugia. These regional-scale drought-sensitivity patterns discerned from remote sensing can complement plot-scale studies of plant physiological responses to drought to help inform climate-adaptation planning as drought conditions intensify.},

We conducted a spatially explicit analysis of 518 433 growth records for 274 species from a 50-h\- a tropical forest plot to test neighborhood complementarity, the idea that a tree grows faster when it is surrounded by more dissimilar neighbors. We found evidence for complementarity: focal tree growth rates increased by 39.8\% and 34.2\% with a doubling of neighborhood multi-\-trait dissimilarity and phylogenetic dissimilarity, respectively. Dissimilarity from neighbors in maximum height had the most important effect on tree growth among the six traits examined, and indeed, its effect trended much larger than that of the multi-\- trait dissimilarity index. Neighborhood complementarity effects were strongest for light-\- demanding species, and decreased in importance with increasing shade tolerance of the focal individuals. Simulations demonstrated that the observed neighborhood complementarities were sufficient to produce positive stand-l\-evel biodiversity\textendash productivity relationships. We conclude that neighborhood complementarity is important for productivity in this tropical forest, and that scaling down to individual-l\-evel processes can advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying stand-l\-evel biodiversity\textendash productivity relationships.},

The logistic model allowed flexibility to easily scale results up to a stand level for comparison to the empirical methods. The empirical method, developed by Munson and Anhold, most closely correlated to the logistic regression results. However, the Munson/Anhold method rated all 45 study sites as either moderately or highly susceptible to bark-beetle attack, which raises concern about Its lack of sensitivity.

Equations often have been developed using differing methods and applied only to certain species or isolated areas. We previously had compiled and combined (in meta-analysis) available diameter-based allometric regression equations for estimating total aboveground and component dry-weight biomass for US trees. This had resulted in a set of 10 consistent, national-scale aboveground biomass regression equations for US species, as well as equations for predicting biomass of tree components as proportions of total aboveground biomass. In this update of our published equation database and refinement of our model, we developed equations based on allometric scaling theory, using taxonomic groupings and wood specific gravity as surrogates for scaling parameters that we could not estimate. The new approach resulted in 35 theoretically based generalized equations (13 conifer, 18 hardwood, 4 woodland), compared with the previous empirically grouped 10. For trees from USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) plots, with forest types grouped into conifers and hardwoods, previous and updated equations produced nearly identical estimates that predicted {$\sim$}20 per cent higher biomass than FIA estimates. Differences were observed between previous and updated equation estimates when comparisons were made using individual FIA forest types. \textcopyright{} 2013 Institute of Chartered Foresters, All rights reserved.

Consistent with theory, in four of five communities indirect effects are strongest for species showing weak negative frequency dependence.

Large stand-level shifts underway in western forests already are showing the importance of interactions involving drought, insects, and fire. Diebacks, changes in composition and structure, and shifting range limits are widely observed. In the eastern US, the effects of increasing drought are becoming better understood at the level of individual trees, but this knowledge cannot yet be confidently translated to predictions of changing structure and diversity of forest stands. While eastern forests have not experienced the types of changes seen in western forests in recent decades, they too are vulnerable to drought and could experience significant changes with increased severity, frequency, or duration in drought. Throughout the continental United States, the combination of projected large climate-induced shifts in suitable habitat from modeling studies and limited potential for the rapid migration of tree populations suggests that changing tree and forest biogeography could substantially lag habitat shifts already underway. Forest management practices can partially ameliorate drought impacts through reductions in stand density, selection of drought-tolerant species and genotypes, artificial regeneration, and the development of multistructured stands. However, silvicultural treatments also could exacerbate drought impacts unless implemented with careful attention to site and stand characteristics. Gaps in our understanding should motivate new research on the effects of interactions involving climate and other species at the stand scale and how interactions and multiple responses are represented in models. This assessment indicates that, without a stronger empirical basis for drought impacts at the stand scale, more complex models may provide limited guidance.},

The purpose of this study is to quantify historical tree spatial patterns and assess recent mortality trends for old and large tree populations in dry mixed-conifer forests of the Northern Rocky Mountains. We analyzed historical reconstructions of forest spatial structure across six 1.0ha plots located in mixed ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir stands in western Montana, USA. Across plots, 10-23\% of trees occurred as widely spaced individuals (no neighbors within 6m), with the remaining 77-90\% of trees occurring in clumps (groups of two or more trees spaced less than 6m apart). Mean clump size was 2.2-4.2 trees per clump, although large clumps (\textbackslash textgreater10 trees) were common. Global spatial analysis with the pair correlation function indicated that ponderosa pine patterns were spatially random at all scales, while Douglas-fir trees were spatially aggregated at scales less than 6m. The proportion of plot area farther than 9m from the nearest tree ranged from 1\% to 20\% across the six study plots. Mortality rates between 1991 and 2012 averaged 0.8\%yr-1 for old ponderosa pine and 2.1\%yr-1 for old Douglas-fir. We found limited evidence of density-dependent mortality for both species pooled and for ponderosa pine individually. Douglas-fir that died between 1991 and 2012 had higher local Stand Density Index (SDI) of Douglas-fir neighbors than did Douglas-fir that survived (P=0.003), indicating conspecific density-dependent mortality. When compared to ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer forests in other regions, trees were distributed much more evenly across clump sizes in our Montana study sites. Our analysis provides an estimate of the historical range of variability for spatial aspects of forest structure in dry mixed-conifer forests of the northern US Rockies and is relevant to the design of restoration and climate change adaptation treatments in such forests.},

  abstract = {1. The neutral theory debate has highlighted the scarcity of robust empirical estimates of the magnitude of competitive effects and responses within guilds of co-occurring tree species. Our analysis quantifies the relative magnitude of all possible pairwise competitive interactions within a guild of nine co-occurring tree species in temperate forests of northern, interior British Columbia, and explicitly partitions the competitive effects of neighbours into the effects of shading versus the residual effects of 'crowding', assumed to reflect below-ground competition. 2. Models that treated neighbours as equivalent in their competitive effects were the most parsimonious for the five species with the smallest sample sizes. For the remaining species (samples sizes of \textbackslash textgreater 150 individuals), the best models estimated separate competition coefficients for all nine species of neighbours. We take this as evidence that species do indeed differ in their competitive effects, but that there can be a minimum sample size required to discriminate between them. 3. There was a strong size-dependency in potential growth. Six species showed an optimal growth at a size between 5 and 20 cm diameter. Potential growth declined moderately to strongly as diameter increased. Sensitivity to crowding varied as a function of tree size for five of the nine species; however, this response was not consistent by tree species. 4. The magnitude of reduction in growth due to crowding was greater on average than the reduction in growth due to shading, except for the two least shade tolerant conifers. Sensitivity to shading among the conifer species was correlated with their shade tolerance. 5. The per capita effects of crowding by different species of neighbours varied widely. A large number of the estimated pairwise per capita competition coefficients were very low. The relative magnitude of the strength of intra- versus interspecific competition also varied widely among the tree species. 6. Synthesis. Model selection techniques effectively separated above- and below-ground competition in complex forests, and allowed us to assess differences among species in competitive effects and responses. While below-ground effects were strong, they were due to proximity of neighbours from a very specific (and small) subset of strong competitors within the guild. Response to crowding varied with tree size but the nature of the relationship varied widely among the species. \textcopyright{} 2008 The Authors.},

The greatest survival and emergence of beetles/unit area of bark occurred in trees of large diameter. After most trees of large diam were killed, gallery starts and egg production continued to increase. However, larval survival declined and emergence returned to the endemic level. At high densities of gallery starts and inches, beetle survival was low, probably because of excessive competition among larvae and drying of phloem. Under these conditions of stress, the sex ratio appears to shift further in favor of after most of the large trees are killed. These observations demonstrate the close association of beetle dynamics with diam structure of lodgepole pine stands, and support the theory that epidemics are strongly dependent upon the presence of large trees having thick phloem.}

  abstract = {Despite the increasing relevance of mixed stands due to their potential benefits; little information is available with regard to the effect of mixtures on yield in forest systems. Hence, it is necessary to study inter-specific relationships, and the resulting yield in mixed stands, which may vary with stand development, site or stand density, etc. In Spain, the province of Navarra is considered one of the biodiversity reservoirs; however, mixed forests occupy only a small area, probably as a consequence of management plans, in which there is an excessive focus on the productivity aspect, favoring the presence of pure stands of the most marketable species. The aim of this paper is to study how growth efficiencies of beech (Fagus sylvatica) and pine (Pinus sylvestris) are modified by the admixture of the other species and to determine whether stand density modifies interspecific relationships and to what extent. Two models were fitted from Spanish National Forest Inventory data, for P. sylvestris and F. sylvatica respectively, which relate the growth efficiency of the species, i.e. the volume increment of the species divided by the species proportion by area, with dominant height, quadratic mean diameter, stocking degree, and the species proportions by area of each species. Growth efficiency of pine increased with the admixture of beech, decreasing this positive effect when stocking degree increased. However, the positive effect of pine admixture on beech growth was greater at higher stocking degrees. Growth efficiency of beech was also dependent on stand dominant height, resulting in a net negative mixing effect when stand dominant heights and stocking degrees were simultaneously low. There is a relatively large range of species proportions and stocking degrees which results in transgressive overyielding: higher volume increments in mixed stands than that of the most productive pure pine stands. We concluded that stocking degree is a key factor in between-species interactions, being the effects of mixing not always greater at higher stand densities, but it depends on species composition. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

An improved understanding of how competition can be measured and how it conditions individual tree growth is needed for projecting the development of these forests, with and without treatment. Numerous studies have evaluated how competition affects tree growth and many indices have been developed to quantify the competition an individual tree experiences. These studies suggest that no single competition index or a single class of indices is universally superior; indices perform differently according to forest type and forest conditions. We chose several widely used distance-independent and distance-dependent competition indices, and also derived anisotropic distance-dependent indices from estimates of light interception by tree crowns. We evaluated the effectiveness of these competition measures for predicting basal area increment (BAI) of Pinus ponderosa, Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Larix occidentalis in western Montana. The best distance-dependent competition indices explained a larger proportion of growth variation than the best distance-independent indices (64\% vs. 56\%). This result indicates that competition is an important growth determinant in these forests and that competition varies locally, with variable tree densities and relatively complex stand structures creating heterogeneous neighborhood conditions. Competition indices derived from light interception models were only weakly correlated with other indices and performed poorly in terms of predicting tree growth. This result accords with previous observations that competition for light is not the primarily growth limitation for trees in the semi-arid conditions of western Montana. More sophisticated light availability models could be used to better assess variability in light interception and its marginal contribution to predictive accuracy of radial tree growth. Diameter and distance-dependent BAI models were developed for growth prediction at the species level and for all species combined. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Following high-severity fire, forest recovery may be compromised by lack of tree seed sources, warmer and drier postfire climate, or short-interval reburning. A potential outcome of the loss of resilience is the conversion of the prefire forest to a different forest type or nonforest vegetation. Conversion implies major, extensive, and enduring changes in dominant species, life forms, or functions, with impacts on ecosystem services. In the present article, we synthesize a growing body of evidence of fire-driven conversion and our understanding of its causes across western North America. We assess our capacity to predict conversion and highlight important uncertainties. Increasing forest vulnerability to changing fire activity and climate compels shifts in management approaches, and we propose key themes for applied research coproduced by scientists and managers to support decision-making in an era when the prefire forest may not return.},

  abstract = {Climate variability at decadal scales influences not only the growth of widely distributed species such as Pinus ponderosa, but also can have an effect on the timing and severity of fire and insect outbreaks that may alter species distributions. In this paper, we present a spatial modelling technique to assess the influence of climatic variability on the annual productivity of P. ponderosa in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of North America over the past 100 years and infer how a sustained change in climate might alter the geographic distribution of this species across defined ecotones. Field observations were used to establish criteria for P. ponderosa dominance including: (1) maximum summer leaf area index (LAI), ranges between 1.5 and 2.5; (2) 80\% of available soil water is depleted during summer months; and (3) soil water will return to full capacity at least once during the year. Where these three criteria were not met, eventual replacement of P. ponderosa would be predicted. We utilized a simple physiological model, Physiological Principles for Predicting Growth (3-PG) to predict annual variation in LAI from climatic data provided by the Oregon Climate Service over the period from 1900 to 2000 and from broad scale 0.5\textdegree -spatial resolution future climate projections produced by the Hadley Climate Center, UK. From these simulations we produced a series of maps that display predicted shifts of zones where ponderosa pine might be expected to contract or expand its range if modeled climatic conditions at annual and decadal intervals were sustained. From the historical simulations, the most favorable year for pine dominance was 1958 and the least favorable, 1924. The most favorable decade was in the 1900s and the least favorable in the 1930s. The future predictions indicate a reduction in the current range of the P. ponderosa type along the western Cascade Range however, an increase along the east side and inland PNW. The model predicts that pine dominance should increase between 5 and 10\% over the next century, mainly in inland Oregon, Idaho, and Washington. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {In the Pacific northwestern (PNW) region of North America, climatic conditions have significantly warmed since a predominantly cool phase of the Pacific North American circulation patterns between 1950 and 1975. What are the implications of this shift in climate for the vulnerability of native tree species? To address this question, we combined mechanistic and statistical models to assess where a variety of native tree species might be more vulnerable within their recorded ranges and where they might potentially migrate. For long-lived species that are well adapted to compete, seasonal differences in photosynthesis and water use offer insights helpful in predicting their distributions. To evaluate the general response of conifers to climatic variation across the region, we previously applied a process-based model (3-PG), to simulate the growth and maximum leaf area index that Douglas-fir could attain within recognized forested areas. We then constructed automated decision tree models to define and map the ecological distributions of 15 tree species based on differences in how photosynthesis was constrained by drought, daytime temperatures, high evaporative demand, and the frequency of frost. For the baseline climate period (1950-1975), the decision tree models predicted presence and absence of each species at {$\sim$}23,000 observations with an average accuracy of 81\%, with an average kappa statistic of 0.74. In this paper the same models were run annually for the period between 1976 and 2006 for each species, and the areas defined as remaining suitable or becoming vulnerable to disturbance were identified based on whether more or less than half of the years fell within the originally defined limits. Based on these criteria, 70\% of the species recorded ranges remained suitable, with 30\% deemed vulnerable. Results varied notably by species with western red cedar and western hemlock remaining highly adapted, with potential for range expansion in area of up to 50\% relative to the baseline period. In contrast, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, grand, and noble fir were classified as vulnerable with potential net contractions in their ranges. The analysis was extended through the rest of the 21st century using climatic projections from the Canadian global circulation model with a high fossil fuel emission scenario (A2) and compared to other previously published species range predictions. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We developed a means of producing spatially explicit datasets of pine density at 30-m resolution using existing geospatial datasets of vegetation composition and structure. Because our ultimate goal is to model MPB population success, three study areas in the western United States that have experienced recent MPB outbreaks were used for evaluation. Pine density estimates for each study area were compared to measures of cumulative MPB-caused pine mortality summarized from annual Aerial Detection Surveys (ADS). ADS data provide spatial and temporal representations of MPB-caused pine mortality collected by observers in fixed wing aircraft and are the most readily available estimates of landscape-scale impacts of MPB. Regression analyses using LANDFIRE ecological systems classifications (EVTs) as units of analysis showed that the best pine density estimates explained 75 to 98\% of cumulative MPB-caused tree mortality. LANDFIRE EVTs, which provide an index of the plant communities growing in a particular 30-m cell, effectively delineate distinct vegetation types that are meaningful suitability indicators for MPB-caused tree mortality. Our analyses suggested that available geospatial vegetation datasets derived from field data and remotely sensed imagery are useful for producing spatially explicit measures of pine density for use in landscape-level modeling of MPB dynamics.},

In the Pacific Northwest of North America (PNW), disturbance by wildfires strongly shapes the composition and structure of lowland forests, but understanding the role of fire over periods of climate change is challenging, because fire-return intervals are long (e.g., millennia) and the coniferous trees dominating these forests can live for many centuries. We developed stand-scale paleorecords of vegetation and fire that span nearly the past 14,000 yr to study how fire was associated with state changes and rapid dynamics in forest vegetation at the stand scale (1\textendash 3 ha). We studied forest history with sediment cores from small hollow sites in the Marckworth State Forest, located {$\sim$}1 km apart in the Tsuga heterophylla Zone in the Puget Lowland ecoregion of western Washington, USA. The median rate of change in pollen/spore assemblages was similar between sites (0.12 and 0.14\% per year), but at both sites, rates of change increased significantly following fire events (ranging up to 1\% per year, with a median of 0.28 and 0.38\%, P \textbackslash textless 0.003). During times of low climate velocity, forest composition was resilient to fires, which initiated successional pathways leading back to the dominant vegetation type. In contrast, during times of high climate variability and velocity (e.g., the early Holocene) forests were not resilient to fires, which triggered large-scale state changes. These records provide clear evidence that disturbance, in the form of an individual fire event, can be an important catalyst for rapid state changes, accelerating vegetation shifts in response to large-scale climate change.},

  abstract = {The Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) is a distance-independent, individual-tree forest growth model widely used in the United States to support management decisionmaking. Stands are the basic projection unit, but the spatial scope can be many thousands of stands. The temporal scope is several hundred years at a resolution of 5-10 years. Projections start with a summary of current conditions evident in the input inventory data. FVS contains a self-calibration feature that uses measured growth rates to modify predictions for local conditions. Component models predict the growth and mortality of individual trees, and extensions to the base model represent disturbance agents including insects, pathogens, and fire. The component models differ depending on the geographic region represented by regionally specific model variants. The differences are due to data availability and the applicability of existing models. The model supports specification of management rules in the input, such as thinning if density is too high. The rules can be extended to represent other factors. For example, the effect of climate change on stand development by entering rules that specify how growth and mortality will change in response to changing climate. Applications range from development of silvicultural prescription for single stands to landscape and large regional assessments. Key issues addressed with FVS include forest development, wildlife habitat, pest outbreaks, and fuels management. The predictions are used to gain insights into how forested environments will respond to alternative management actions. Broad-scale forest management policies have been studied with FVS. For the 30 years since the model was initially introduced, the development team has anticipated and provided needed enhancements and maintained a commitment to working with and training users. The existence of an adequate user interface and the continued use of the original programming language are often overlooked factors for the success of this model. Future work will focus on improving FVS by adopting recent biometric techniques and including new information linking geomorphology to mortality and growth. Extending the model to more closely represent biophysical processes and adapting the model so that it is more relevant to management questions related to predicted climate change are also foci. Providing ways to dynamically link FVS to other models is our current strategy for providing major new capabilities.},

Individual tree climate viability scores measure the likelihood that the climate at a given location and at a given point in time is consistent with the climate recorded for species' contemporary distribution. These viability scores are input into Climate-FVS. A web-based service is available for providing this input for climate predictions generated by down scaling general circulation model (GCM) outputs run using several models and scenarios from the IPCC third (IPCC 2000) and fifth assessments (IPCC 2013). Climate-FVS contains components that modify mortality and growth rates, plus rules for establishing new trees. Commands are presented that control the model. These commands enable the users to explore the model's sensitivity to model components and parameters, to include pertinent information unknown to the model, and use the model to simulate management alternatives. Model outputs are very sensitive to the mortality component, are moderately sensitive to growth rate modifications, and are sensitive to maximum density adjustment only when a stand's maximum density is being approached. The intended model uses are to provide insights into future forest dynamics that are not otherwise evident, to provide model outputs that are relevant to forest managers, to provide a consistent way to compare management alternatives, and to do so using defensible methods.},

The collaborative group developed a gradient of adaptation treatments (i.e., resistance, resilience, and transition) focused on climate change at Coram Experimental Forest and the Flathead National Forest. Treatments are scheduled, and monitoring will follow to fuel future research and to help guide regional managers who seek to learn from our treatments. We conclude with predictions of future dynamics in these stands and emphasize the value of landscape heterogeneity and the necessity of long-term monitoring for silvicultural experiments.},

  abstract = {G NERAL principles of forest management were estab\- lished over 200 years ago in Central Europe and the task of the American forester has been largely to adapt these principles to the management of the vast, rough, and inacces\- sible natural forests of this country. A series of essentially new problems has arisen, however. In the humid climate where forestry originated, forest fires are relatively rare and unimportant, while in the New World, fire protection is the most serious of all problems facing American foresters. This has necessitated the development of methods of investigation for which there is little precedent.}

  abstract = {Climate change indirectly affects forest ecosystems through changes in the frequency, size, and/or severity of wildfires. In addition to its direct effects prior to fire, climate also influences immediate postfire recruitment, with consequences for future vegetation structure and fire activity. A major uncertainty, therefore, is if, when and where vegetation shifts will occur. With an emphasis on species traits, we use a demographic framework to examine how the interaction of changing climate and fire will affect postfire woody vegetation recruitment and the likelihood of vegetation shifts. Each demographic stage \textendash{} adult mortality, propagule availability, seed germination, seedling establishment, and seedling survival \textendash{} serves as a filter through which a species must pass for establishment and recovery to occur. We apply this framework to case studies in western North American forests, including boreal and southwestern U.S. Pinus ponderosa forests, to help understand the mechanisms behind recent postfire vegetation changes. The case studies highlight how changes in climate and fire properties will make it increasingly difficult for some species to pass through each demographic filter in the future. As climate warming continues, we expect increased dominance of species that resprout following fire, maintain canopy or soil seed banks, have long distance seed dispersal, produce drought-tolerant seedlings, and/or reach reproductive maturity quickly. The persistence of postfire vegetation shifts will depend the on ratio of recovery time to disturbance interval(s). An advantage of the demographic-filter framework is that it places emphasis on mechanisms, thus improving our ability to anticipate future vegetation shifts. As such, it highlights the clear need for more mechanistic studies of postfire recruitment to disentangle the relative effects of multiple drivers in postfire environments.

  abstract = {Climate change is increasing fire activity in the western United States, which has the potential to accelerate climate-induced shifts in vegetation communities. Wildfire can catalyze vegetation change by killing adult trees that could otherwise persist in climate conditions no longer suitable for seedling establishment and survival. Recently documented declines in postfire conifer recruitment in thewestern United States may be an example of this phenomenon. However, the role of annual climate variation and its interaction with long-term climate trends in driving these changes is poorly resolved. Here we examine the relationship between annual climate and postfire tree regeneration of two dominant, low-elevation conifers (ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir) using annually resolved establishment dates from 2,935 destructively sampled trees from 33 wildfires across four regions in the western United States. We show that regeneration had a nonlinear response to annual climate conditions, with distinct thresholds for recruitment based on vapor pressure deficit, soil moisture, and maximum surface temperature. At dry sites across our study region, seasonal to annual climate conditions over the past 20 years have crossed these thresholds, such that conditions have become increasingly unsuitable for regeneration. High fire severity and low seed availability further reduced the probability of postfire regeneration. Together, our results demonstrate that climate change combined with high severity fire is leading to increasingly fewer opportunities for seedlings to establish after wildfires and may lead to ecosystem transitions in low-elevation ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir forests across the western United States.},

Because both of these phenomena can severely affect system survival, ecol- ogists are confronted with the question of why complex ecosystems do, in fact, exist. Our study analyzes the basic themes of this research and identifies five general hypotheses that, in recent years, theoretical ecologists have built into models to increase their stability against disruptive feedback and stochasticity. To counter feedback instabilities, theoreti- cians have considered (1) functional interactions between species that act as stabilizers, (2) disturbance patterns that interrupt adverse feedback effects, and (3) the stabilizing effect of integrating small-spatial-scale systems into large landscapes. To decrease the influence of stochasticity, modelers have hypothesized (4) compensatory mechanisms operating at low population densities, and (5) the moderating effect of spatial extent and heterogeneity. We show that modeling based on these ideas can be organized in a systematic way. We also show that the stable equilibrium state should not be viewed as a fundamental property of ecological systems, but as a property that can emerge asymptotically from extrapolation to sufficiently large spatial scales},

The influence of thinning intensity (high, medium, low and a control) and its effect on the mid-term (thinned plots in 1998 and 2008) on the water cycle (transpiration, soil water and interception) and growth [basal area increment (BAI)] were investigated in 55-year-old Aleppo pine trees. Thinning enhanced a lower dependence of growth on climate fluctuations. The high-intensity treatment showed significant increases in the mean annual BAI (from 4.1 to 17.3 cm2) that was maintained in the mid-term. Thinning intensity progressively increased the sap flow velocity (v s) in all cases with respect to the control. In the mid-term, an increased functionality of the inner sapwood was also observed. Mean daily tree water use ranged from 5 (control) to 18 (high intensity) l tree-1. However, when expressed on an area basis, daily transpiration ranged from 0.18 (medium) to 0.30 mm (control), meaning that in spite of the higher transpiration rates in the remaining trees, stand transpiration was reduced with thinning. Deep infiltration of water was also enhanced with thinning (about 30 \% of rainfall) and did not compete with transpiration, as both presented opposite seasonal patterns. The changes in the stand water relationships after 10 years were well explained by the forest cover metric. The blue to green water ratio changed from 0.15 in the control to 0.72 in the high-intensity treatment, with the remaining treatments in the 0.34-0.48 range. \textcopyright{} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Wildfires, bark beetle outbreaks, winds, and avalanches cause relatively drastic changes in community structure, composition, and function. These disturbances may occur independently or interact where the incidence of one may change the potential for another. We assessed potential wildfire behaviour change in the wake of a catastrophic, landscape-wide spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) outbreak in southern Utah, USA. Using data collected in spruce forests affected by the outbreak, the Forest Vegetation Simulator and Fire and Fuels Extension were used to simulate long-term (100 y) stand dynamics and potential fire behaviour under 3 reconstructed scenarios: no spruce beetle outbreak (low-severity), 50\% spruce beetle-caused mortality (mid-severity), and 95\% spruce beetle-caused mortality (high-severity). Simulations suggested a likely reduction in probability of active crown fire for 1 or 2 decades on near-pure Engelmann spruce sites after high-severity mortality. This counterintuitive result suggested extreme fire behaviour is not an inevitable consequence of spruce beetle outbreaks. No change in potential fire behaviour was predicted in stands with the least reduction in spruce basal area (low- or mid-severity). In one stand with a history of surface fire, stand structure and potential fire behaviour from low- and high-severity simulations were influenced by surface fire {$\sim$}100 y ago. These results are indicative of complex disturbance interactions that were influenced by the host-specific spruce beetle, resultant stand structures and fuel profiles, and in one case antecedent disturbance.},

While such theoretical relationships explain much of the variation across large scales, at any particular scale there is important residual variation that is left unexplained among species, among individuals within a species, and within individuals themselves. Key questions remain on what explains this variability and how we can apply this information in practice, in particular to produce estimates in high-diversity systems with many rare and under-sampled species. We apply hierarchical Bayes statistical techniques to data on crown geometry from diverse temperate forests in order to simultaneously model the differences within and among species. We find that tree height, canopy depth, and canopy radius are affected by both successional stage and wood mechanical strength, while tree height conforms to the predicted 2/3 power relationship. Furthermore, we show that hierarchical modeling allows us to constrain the allometries of rare species much more than traditional methods. Finally, crown radius was shown to vary substantially more within individuals than among individuals or species, suggesting that the capacity for local light foraging and crown plasticity exerts the dominant control on tree crowns. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Five pathways are identified as the basis for functional groupings: increases in leaf, stem and root turnover, and reductions in phloem and xylem transport. A simple ecophysiological model was used to explore the sensitivity of forest growth, mortality and ecosystem fluxes to varying outbreak severity. Across all pathways, low infection was associated with growth reduction but limited mortality. Moderate infection led to individual tree mortality, whereas high levels led to stand-level die-offs delayed over multiple years. Delayed mortality is consistent with observations and critical for capturing biophysical, biogeochemical and successional responses. This framework enables novel predictions under present and future global change scenarios.},

  abstract = {Aim of the study: This paper presents the most appropriate ways to estimate the species proportions by area in mixed stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) by comparing stand level and individual tree level approaches. It also investigates whether different ways of describing species proportions by area can result in different judgments on the over- or under-yielding of species in mixtures. Area of the study: Three triplets of pure and mixed stands of Norway spruce and European beech in three locations in the northeast of Austria are investigated. The three locations differ considerably in slope, bedrock and soil type as well as in site index. Material and methods: In all 9 plots the coordinates of all trees, their dbh, height, height to the crown base and five year increment were measured. The potentially available areas of individual trees are calculated by Voronoi- diagrams and potential densities are estimated from the comparable pure stands, yield tables, and published equations for maximum basal area and Reineke's maximum density line. Main results: The species proportions estimated by the individual tree approach with leaf area as growth characteristic gave the best fit with the stand approach with the most appropriate, regional maximum basal area equations. By using various definitions of species proportions, in the worst case the mixing effects on individual species can be seriously over- or underestimated while the mixing effects on the total increment is only negligibly affected. Research highlights: \textemdash{} Measures of species proportions by area are needed for comparing growth per hectare of a species in a mixed stand with that of the same species in a pure stand. \textemdash{} Species proportions at the stand level are based on estimates of the species' potential densities, either in terms of maximum basal area or of maximum stand density index. \textemdash{} Species proportions at the tree level are derived from the area potentially available (APA) to the individual trees, based on the coordinates of trees in the stands, and on their growth characteristics, such as crown projection area or leaf area. \textemdash{} For the examples of Norway spruce - European beech stands, the species proportions derived according to the individual tree approach using leaf area as growth characteristics fits best with the stand approach using the most appropriate maximum basal area equations.},

  abstract = {Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) dominate many of the European forest stands. Also, mixtures of European beech and Scots pine more or less occur over all European countries, but have been scarcely investigated. The area occupied by each species is of high relevance, especially for growth evaluation and comparison of different species in mixed and monospecific stands. Thus, we studied different methods to describe species proportions and their definition as proportion by area. 25 triplets consisting of mixed and monospecific stands were established across Europe ranging from Lithuania to Spain in northern to southern direction and from Bulgaria to Belgium in eastern to western direction. On stand level, the conclusive method for estimating the species proportion as a fraction of the stand area relates the observed density (tree number or basal area) to its potential. This stand-level estimation makes use of the potential from comparable neighboring monospecific stands or from maximum density lines derived from other data, e.g. forest inventories or permanent observations plots. At tree level, the fraction of the stand area occupied by a species can be derived from the proportions of their crown projection area or of their leaf area. The estimates of the potentials obtained from neighboring monospecific stands, especially in older stands, were poorer than those from the maximum density line depending on the Martonne aridity index. Therefore, the stand-level method in combination with the Martonne aridity index for potential densities can be highly recommended. The species' proportions estimated with this method are best approximated by the proportions of the species' leaf areas. In forest practice, the most commonly applied method is an ocular estimation of the proportions by crown projection area. Even though the proportions of pine were calculated here by measuring crown projection areas in the field, we found this method to underestimate the proportion by 25\% compared to the stand-level approach.},

  abstract = {Background: Fuel treatments are widely used to alter fuels in forested ecosystems to mitigate wildfire behavior and effects. However, few studies have examined long-term ecological effects of interacting fuel treatments (commercial harvests, pre-commercial thinnings, pile and burning, and prescribed fire) and wildfire. Using annually fitted Landsat satellite-derived Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) curves and paired pre-fire treated and untreated field sites, we tested changes in the differenced NBR (dNBR) and years since treatment as predictors of biophysical attributes one and nine years after the 2007 Egley Fire Complex in Oregon, USA. We also assessed short- and long-term fuel treatment impacts on field-measured attributes one and nine years post fire. Results: One-year post-fire burn severity (dNBR) was lower in treated than in untreated sites across the Egley Fire Complex. Annual NBR trends showed that treated sites nearly recovered to pre-fire values four years post fire, while untreated sites had a slower recovery rate. Time since treatment and dNBR significantly predicted tree canopy and understory green vegetation cover in 2008, suggesting that tree canopy and understory vegetation cover increased in areas that were treated recently pre fire. Live tree density was more affected by severity than by pre-fire treatment in either year, as was dead tree density one year post fire. In 2008, neither treatment nor severity affected percent cover of functional groups (shrub, graminoid, forb, invasive, and moss\textendash lichen\textendash fungi); however, by 2016, shrub, graminoid, forb, and invasive cover were higher in high-severity burn sites than in low-severity burn sites. Total fuel loads nine years post fire were higher in untreated, high-severity burn sites than any other sites. Tree canopy cover and density of trees, saplings, and seedlings were lower nine years post fire than one year post fire across treatments and severity, whereas live and dead tree basal area, understory surface cover, and fuel loads increased. Conclusions: Pre-fire fuel treatments effectively lowered the occurrence of high-severity wildfire, likely due to successful pre-fire tree and sapling density and surface fuels reduction. This study also quantified the changes in vegetation and fuels from one to nine years post fire. We suggest that low-severity wildfire can meet prescribed fire management objectives of lowering surface fuel accumulations while not increasing overstory tree mortality.},

  abstract = {Forest decline, attributed to increased aridity under global climate change, has been observed with rising frequency worldwide. One of the knowledge gaps making its spatially explicit prediction difficult is the identification of the climatic settings that generate a significant change in the forest state. A relatively rare sequence of unfavourable climatic events - a short extreme drought followed by a prolonged moderate drought within one decade - has allowed us to examine how rainfall amount affects forest performance. Large-scale monitoring, at high spatial and temporal resolutions, is required to study climatic effects on forest performance. Therefore, time-series of spatially interpolated rainfall maps, remote sensing images and tree growth data were used to estimate the environmental settings to which the forests are exposed, and the corresponding forest performance responses. Performance was estimated from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values obtained from 32 Landsat satellite images for 1994-2011. To widen the study perspective we sampled forest performance along a rainfall gradient (250-750. mm) in the planted Pinus halepensis forests in Israel. Performance response was not spatially homogeneous. Three response types could be identified along the rainfall gradient: stable performance with low correlation to rainfall pattern in the humid region (\textbackslash textgreater500. mm), moderate performance decline with high correlation to rainfall in the intermediate region (350-500. mm), and steep performance decline with intermediate correlation to rainfall in the arid region (\textbackslash textless350. mm). The response to the second drought differed among regions, unlike the response to the first drought, which was homogeneous. The observed diverging performance trend along the climatic gradient can be attributed to the varied importance of water availability as a limiting factor. The reduced effect of rainfall on performance deviations, the steep performance decline, and the difference between responses to the first and second droughts at the most arid locations, imply to higher importance of multi-annual accumulated and carried-over drought stress effects at these locations. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In recent years, warm winters and summers have allowed MPB populations to achieve synchronous emergence and successful attacks, resulting in widespread population outbreaks and resultant tree mortality across western North America. We develop an age-structured forest demographic model that incorporates temperature-dependent MPB infestations. Stability of fixed points is analyzed as a function of (thermally controlled) MPB population growth rates and indicates the existence of periodic outbreaks that intensify as growth rates increase. We devise analytical methods to predict outbreak severity and duration as well as outbreak return time. After incorporating a spatial aspect and controlling initial stand demographic variation, the model predicts cycle periods that fall within observed outbreak return time ranges. To assess future MPB impact on forests, we use climate model projected temperatures with our model-based approximation methods to predict potential severity of future outbreaks that reflect the effects of changing climate.},

  abstract = {Increasing emphasis on ecological objectives such as biodiversity in forestry has precipitated interest in multiaged silvicultural methods that create and maintain more complex stand structures than simpler even-aged methods. Foresters often use the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) growth model to compare competing silvicultural alternatives, which can include multiaged structures. For models such as FVS to be useful for this task, they must realistically simulate structural dynamics in multiaged stands. We evaluated FVS performance for trees in even-aged and multiaged stands of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa C. Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.) in the Black Hills, USA, by comparing FVS predictions of dbh increment to measurements from increment cores. Dbh change is the primary element of tree growth estimated by the regional FVS variant used in the Black Hills and is the basis for all other aspects of tree growth. We found that the dbh growth model used by FVS was more biased and less accurate for trees in multiaged stands than for trees in even-aged stands and that residual error varied systematically with tree size class in multiaged stands, which could affect stand dynamics simulation. Performance improved for trees in multiaged stands when predictions were adjusted with a model that included crown ratio (CR), which is related to photosynthetic capacity and tree growth. A CR-based adjustment did not improve model predictions for trees in even-aged stands, presumably because CR was less variable than in multiaged stands and because stand structures were more similar to those used for model development. This study illustrates the potential for empirical forest growth models such as FVS to behave in unexpected ways when they are used for stands and trees that are dissimilar from those used for model development. It also highlights the importance of continued model testing because growth models are increasingly used to develop silvicultural alternatives for structurally complex stands. \textcopyright{} 2014 Society of American Foresters.},

When CBD and CBH are estimated using nonlocal crown fuel biomass allometries and uniform crown fuel distribution assumptions, as is common practice, values may differ from estimates made using local allometries and nonuniform distributions. We estimated CBD and CBH for mostly pure, even-aged stands of seven conifer species by modifying the Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator to use nonuniform crown fuel distributions, which allowed us to determine whether distribution effects on CBD and CBH estimates were species specific or general. For two species, we also compared estimates from local and nonlocal allometries to ascertain whether there was a consistent bias in CBD and CBH estimates associated with application of allometries outside their geographic area of origin. Using nonuniform distributions caused consistent increases in average CBD estimates of {$\sim$}10 \textendash 30\% for all species compared to estimates obtained using uniform distributions. Effects on CBH varied. Using local allometries did not result in CBD or CBH estimates that were consistently larger or smaller than those obtained using nonlocal allometries. We conclude that using nonuniform distributions invariably increases estimates of CBD for even-aged conifer stands, whereas effects on CBH estimates are difficult to predict and that allometric relationships vary widely among stands in the southern Rocky Mountains.},

Stem selection according to the different strategies were simulated with a starting point from plots with a 5 m radius. All strategies were applied to all of the plots. A growth simulator was used to simulate the stand development up to final felling. This study illustrates the possibilities for influencing the structure of a mixed stand through precommercial thinning. The study also illustrates the long-term effects on stand structure and volume yield by consequently applying a management strategy from precommercial thinning until final felling. Precommercial thinning was found to be a useful tool to influence the stand structure in accordance to the aims set. However, the opportunities for influencing the stand by precommercial thinning were restricted by natural settings and unconditional considerations (e.g. tree vitality, stem quality, regular spacing), beyond what could be judged from stand average data. The stem volume production during a rotation was 6\% lower for (iii) and (iv) compared to (i) and (ii), mainly due to a greater proportion of birch in the former strategies.},

Development of these local and regional fire-scar networks has created a new data type for ecologists interested in landscape and climate regulation of ecosystem processes - which, for example, may help to explain why forest fires are widespread during certain years but not others.

  abstract = {Background: Forests are an important component of the global carbon balance, and climate sensitive growth and yield models are an essential tool when predicting future forest conditions. In this study, we used the dynamic climate capability of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) to simulate future (100 year) forest conditions on four National Forests in the northwestern USA: Payette National Forest (NF), Ochoco NF, Gifford Pinchot NF, and Siuslaw NF. Using Forest Inventory and Analysis field plots, aboveground carbon estimates and species compositions were simulated with Climate-FVS for the period between 2016 and 2116 under a no climate change scenario and a future climate scenario. We included a sensitivity analysis that varied calculated disturbance probabilities and the dClim rule, which is one method used by Climate-FVS to introduce climate-related mortality. The dClim rule initiates mortality when the predicted climate change at a site is greater than the change in climate associated with a predetermined shift in elevation. Results: Results of the simulations indicated the dClim rule influenced future carbon projections more than estimates of disturbance probability. Future aboveground carbon estimates increased and species composition remained stable under the no climate change scenario. The future climate scenario we tested resulted in less carbon at the end of the projections compared to the no climate change scenarios for all cases except when the dClim rule was disengaged on the Payette NF. Under the climate change scenario, species compositions shifted to climatically adapted species or early successional species. Conclusion: This research highlights the need to consider climate projections in long-Term planning or future forest conditions may be unexpected. Forest managers and planners could perform similar simulations and use the results as a planning tool when analyzing climate change effects at the National Forest level.},

Five spacing treatments were studied\textemdash control (no thinning), 5x5 ft, 7x7 ft, 10x10 ft, and 14x14 ft. Sample trees were measured pre- and post-thinning, 3 yrs after thinning, and 5 yrs after thinning, starting in 1997 (Nez Perce sites) and 1998 (Spokane sites). Models of diameter and height growth, change in crown ratio and height to crown base, and probability of western pine shoot borer (Eucosma sonomana Kearfott) infestation were developed. Little mortality occurred after thinning, and the trees that died had small crowns. Diameter growth for all of the spacings was significantly different, with widely spaced trees growing faster than narrowly spaced trees. Trees with larger initial diameters or crown ratios had faster post-thinning diameter growth. Spacing had no influence on height growth. Height growth increased with increasing initial tree size, larger crown ratios, and increasing pre-thinning height growth, but decreased with increasing post-thin basal area. Height/diameter ratios (an indication of tree slenderness and stability) increased over time on the narrower spacings, indicating trees were still crowded. We found that thinnings of at least 10x10 ft are needed to stimulate a change in height/diameter ratio. Wider spacings (10x10 ft and 14x14 ft) resulted in lengthening crowns because height to crown base remained closer to the ground, which had implications for fire management. Shoot borer damage occurred on about one-fourth of the sample trees and was negatively cor- related with elevation and positively correlated with tree vigor. There was no dramatic non-tree vegetation response to the thinnings, which may be related to herbivory or the lack of ground disturbance from the thinning operations. Keywords:},

During endemic populations, trees weakened by other agents are often colonized by D. ponderosae but may be difficult to detect due to their scarcity. Once populations reach incipient levels, tree defenses are often insufficient in deterring mass attacks, and populations rapidly increase causing substantial levels of tree mortality under certain circumstances. There are two general approaches for reducing the negative impacts of D. ponderosae on forests. Direct control involves short-term tactics designed to address current infestations by manipulating beetle populations and includes the use of fire, insecticides, semiochemicals, sanitation harvests, or combinations of these treatments. Indirect control is preventive and designed to reduce the probability and severity of future infestations by manipulating stand, forest and/or landscape conditions by reducing the number of susceptible host trees through thinning, prescribed burning, and/or alterations of age classes and species composition. We review tree, stand, and landscape factors associated with D. ponderosae infestations and analyze the effectiveness of treatments for preventing and mitigating undesirable levels of tree mortality.

  abstract = {Tree growth depends on the resource availability, the proportion of resources acquired, and the efficiency with which those resources are used. Each of these variables can be influenced by species interactions. These interactions are dynamic and change spatially and temporally as resource availability and climatic conditions change. It is important to understand these processes when designing and managing mixed-species stands and also when modelling these processes. These interactions and their dynamics are the focus of this chapter. To begin with, the production ecology equation is described because it provides a useful framework to quantify the types of processes that influence the growth of forests and how these are influenced by species interactions. This equation describes growth as a function of resource availability, resource acquisition, and resource-use efficiency. Then, while referring to this equation, some of the main types of processes are described in terms of how they influence these variables and hence the productivity of mixtures. This is done for nutrients, then light, and thenwater. The influence of a given type of interaction on growth is not static. Instead, it changes with spatial and temporal variability in resource availability and climatic conditions and as a stand develops. Therefore, the next section describes a framework that explains these spatial and temporal dynamics and indicates when different types of interactions are important. Finally, stand density can influence the effect of these interactions. As stand density increases, interactions may become more favourable or less favourable, depending on how, and which, resources are influenced by the change in density. The final section therefore shows why stand density needs to be taken into account when examining how species interact.},

Most conceptual forest development models do not incorporate current knowledge of the: (1) complexity of structures (including spatial patterns) and developmental processes; (2) duration of development in long-lived forests; (3) complex spatial patterns of stands that develop in later stages of seres; and particularly (4) the role of disturbances in creating structural legacies that become key elements of the post-disturbance stands. We elaborate on existing models for stand structural development using natural stand development of the Douglas-fir - western hemlock sere in the Pacific Northwest as our primary example; most of the principles are broadly applicable while some processes (e.g. role of epicormic branches) are related to specific species. We discuss the use of principles from disturbance ecology and natural stand development to create silvicultural approaches that are more aligned with natural processes. Such approaches provide for a greater abundance of standing dead and down wood and large old trees, perhaps reducing short-term commercial productivity but ultimately enhancing wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and ecosystem function, including soil protection and nutrient retention. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We highlight several records from western North America and their relevance in reconstructing historical forest dynamics, fire-climate relationships, and feedbacks between vegetation and fire under climate change. Climatic effects on fire regimes are evident in many regions, but comparisons of paleo-fire records sometimes show a lack of synchrony, indicating that local factors substantially affect fire occurrence, even over long periods. Furthermore, the specific impacts of vegetation change on fire regimes vary among regions with different vegetation histories.

Photosynthesis, biomass allocation and root traits were assessed. Photosynthetic variables responded differently to drought and infection over time. The root mass fraction showed a significant reduction due to infection. P. cinnamomi root rot altered the growth patterns. Plants could not recover from the physiological effects of infection only when the root rot coincided with water stress. Without additional stressors, the strategy of our seedlings in the face of root rot was to reduce the biomass increment and reallocate resources. Underlying mechanisms involved in plant-pathogen interactions should be considered in the study of holm oak decline, beyond the consideration of water stress as the primary cause of tree mortality.},

Even-aged systems (clearcut, seed-tree, and shelterwood) are the most appropriate for growing commercial products. In limited circumstances uneven-aged systems may be appropriate on sites where ponderosa pine is the late seral-species. Planting of improved, site adapted trees usually offer the greatest control over the amount, kind, and establishment of plantations. The control of competing vegetation during the site preparation and tending phases of the silvicultural system is usually extremely beneficial in enhancing tree growth and product development. The forest soils of the Inland West are generally deficient in nitrogen and, in some settings, also potassium deficient. The organic and mineral surface layers, often containing ash and loess soils, are vulnerable to compaction, displacement, or damage from fires (prescribed and wild) or mechanical forest operations. Therefore, soil and its conservation should be integral to all activities included in a silvicultural system. For production forestry, herbicides offer an alternative that can maintain the soil resource yet control competing vegetation and most often yield excellent results when properly applied. Cleanings, weedings and thinnings are integral parts of the silvicultural system. These and all parts of silvicultural systems designed to produce commercial products can be readily quantified, displayed, and visualized (spatially explicit) through time using the Forest Vegetation Simulator.},

U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service scientists, Federal resource managers, and stakeholders collaborated over a 2-year period to conduct a state-of-science climate change vulnerability assessment and develop adaptation options for Federal lands. The vulnerability assessment emphasized key resource areas - water, fisheries, vegetation and disturbance, wildlife, recreation, infrastructure, cultural heritage, and ecosystem services - regarded as the most important for ecosystems and human communities. The earliest and most profound effects of climate change are expected for water resources, the result of declining snowpacks causing higher peak winter streamflows, lower summer flows, and higher stream temperatures. These changes will in turn reduce fish habitat for cold-water fish species, negatively affect riparian vegetation and wildlife, damage roads and other infrastructure, and reduce reliable water supplies for communities. Increased frequency and magnitude of disturbances (drought, insect outbreaks, wildfire) will reduce the area of mature forest, affect wildlife populations (some positively, some negatively), damage infrastructure and cultural resources, degrade the quality of municipal water supplies, and reduce carbon sequestration. Climate change effects on recreation, a major economic driver in the IAP region, will be positive for warm-weather activities and negative for snow-based activities. IAP participants developed adaptation options that can be implemented in planning, project management, monitoring, and restoration as climate-smart responses to altered resource conditions.}

We drew on the results of five published studies and analyzed current and projected future climate suitability for 11 tree species and 8 biome types under two IPCC emissions scenarios. We assessed components of vulnerability based on four metrics of current and projected future climate suitability. Results for biome types indicated largely a shift from climates suitable for alpine and subalpine conifer to climates suitable for desert scrub and grassland types. Results from the four studies of tree species indicated substantial loss of area of climate suitability for the four subalpine species by 2100. This was especially true for Whitebark pine (. Pinus albicaulis). Suitable climate for this species dropped from just over 20\% of the study area in the reference period to 0.5-7.0\% by 2070-2100 under the A2 scenario. The studies agreed in projecting expansion of climate suitability for some montane tree species but disagreed on expansion of climate suitability of west-side mesic tree species to eastside locations such as Yellowstone National park. Importantly, the rankings of tree species vulnerability were similar among studies, scenarios, and geographic areas and indicated highest vulnerability for Whitebark pine and Mountain hemlock (. Tsuga mertensiana). The results should help federal managers in the GNLCC prioritize tree species for climate adaptation strategies. Moreover, our methods for using published data as a basis for climate vulnerability assessment can be applied within other LCCs across the US and other management units internationally.},

  abstract = {In subalpine forests of the western United States that historically experienced infrequent, high-severity fire, whether fire management can shape 21st-century fire regimes and forest dynamics to meet natural resource objectives is not known. Managed wildfire use (i.e., allowing lightning-ignited fires to burn when risk is low instead of suppressing them) is one approach for maintaining natural fire regimes and fostering mosaics of forest structure, stand age, and tree-species composition, while protecting people and property. However, little guidance exists for where and when this strategy may be effective with climate change. We simulated most of the contiguous forest in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, USA to ask: (1) how would subalpine fires and forest structure be different if fires had not been suppressed during the last three decades? And (2) what is the relative influence of climate change vs. fire management strategy on future fire and forests? We contrasted fire and forests from 1989 to 2098 under two fire management scenarios (managed wildfire use and fire suppression), two general circulation models (CNRM-CM5 and GFDL-ESM2M), and two representative concentration pathways (8.5 and 4.5). We found little difference between management scenarios in the number, size, or severity of fires during the last three decades. With 21st-century warming, fire activity increased rapidly, particularly after 2050, and followed nearly identical trajectories in both management scenarios. Area burned per year between 2018 and 2099 was 1,700\% greater than in the last three decades (1989\textendash 2017). Large areas of forest were abruptly lost; only 65\% of the original 40,178 ha of forest remained by 2098. However, forests stayed connected and fuels were abundant enough to support profound increases in burning through this century. Our results indicate that strategies emphasizing managed wildfire use, rather than suppression, will not alter climate-induced changes to fire and forests in subalpine landscapes of western North America. This suggests that managers may continue to have flexibility to strategically suppress subalpine fires without concern for long-term consequences, in distinct contrast with dry conifer forests of the Rocky Mountains and mixed conifer forest of California where maintaining low fuel loads is essential for sustaining frequent, low-severity surface fire regimes.},

Data were obtained from 55 sample plots of pure China-fir plantation stands. An Ordinary Linear Least Squares (OLS) regression was used to establish the crown width model. To adjust for correlations between observations from the same sample plots, we developed one level linear mixed-effects (LME) models based on the multiple linear model, which take into account the random effects of plots. The best random effects combinations for the LME models were determined by the Akaike 's information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion and the -2logarithm likelihood. Heteroscedasticity was reduced by three residual variance functions: the power function, the exponential function and the constant plus power function. The spatial correlation was modeled by three correlation structures: the first-order autoregressive structure [AR(1)], a combination of first-order autoregressive and moving average structures [ARMA (1,1)], and the compound symmetry structure (CS). Then, the LME model was compared to the multiple linear model using the absolute mean residual (AMR), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the adjusted coefficient of determination (adj-R2). For individual tree crown width models, the one level LME model showed the best performance. An independent dataset was used to test the performance of the models and to demonstrate the advantage of calibrating LME models.},

Responses were compared to those from two other studies representing high and low site qualities. Third-year height did not differ among spacings (P = 0.80), providing no evidence that close spacing stimulated early growth. Piecewise regression identified the onset of competition-induced mortality when stand density index (SDI [Reineke, L.H. 1933. Perfecting a stand density index for even-aged forests. Journal of Agricultural Research 46, 627-638]) exceeded 52\% (S.E. = 4.6) of the species' maximum or when average crown ratio (CR) declined below 52\% (S.E. = 0.9). For a range of SDI values, CR averaged 2-7\% points greater at the high-quality site than at the moderate-quality site. In a regression analysis of combined data from the moderate- and high-quality sites, relative values of average stem diameter and stand volume (\% of maximum values observed per site) 23-25 years after planting increased and decreased with planting spacing, respectively (R2 = 0.97 and 0.91, respectively). Intersection of these relationships at 3-m spacing indicated a point of equivalent relative development of tree size and stand yield. For a range of site qualities, stands planted at 3-m spacing: (1) maintained tree vigor (CR {$\geq$} 50\%) and stability (average height:dbh ratio \textbackslash textless90), (2) experienced little or no competition-induced mortality through age 25 years, and (3) allocated 25-year growth equitably to development of tree size and stand yield, thereby providing a desirable starting point for subsequent management.},

  abstract = {Widespread tree mortality caused by outbreaks of native bark beetles (Circulionidae: Scolytinae) in recent decades has raised concern among scientists and forest managers about whether beetle outbreaks fuel more ecologically severe forest fires and impair postfire resilience. To investigate this question, we collected extensive field data following multiple fires that burned subalpine forests in 2011 throughout the Northern Rocky Mountains across a spectrum of prefire beetle outbreak severity, primarily from mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae). We found that recent (2001-2010) beetle outbreak severity was unrelated to most field measures of subsequent fire severity,which was instead driven primarily by extreme burning conditions (weather) and topography. In the red stage (0-2 y following beetle outbreak), fire severity was largely unaffected by prefire outbreak severity with few effects detected only under extreme burning conditions. In the gray stage (3-10 y following beetle outbreak), fire severity was largely unaffected by prefire outbreak severity under moderate conditions, but several measures related to surface fire severity increased with outbreak severity under extreme conditions. Initial postfire tree regeneration of the primary beetle host tree [lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia)] was not directly affected by prefire outbreak severity but was instead driven by the presence of a canopy seedbank and by fire severity. Recent beetle outbreaks in subalpine forests affected few measures of wildfire severity and did not hinder the ability of lodgepole pine forests to regenerate after fire, suggesting that resilience in subalpine forests is not necessarily impaired by recent mountain pine beetle outbreaks.},

  abstract = {Increasing rates of natural disturbances under a warming climate raise important questions about how multiple disturbances interact. Escalating wildfire activity in recent decades has resulted in some forests re-burning in short succession, but how the severity of one wildfire affects that of a subsequent wildfire is not fully understood. We used a field-validated, satellite-derived, burn-severity atlas to assess interactions between successive wildfires across the US Northern Rocky Mountains a 300,000-km2 region dominated by fire-prone forests. In areas that experienced two wildfires between 1984 and 2010, we asked: (1) How do overall frequency distributions of burn-severity classes compare between first and second fires? (2) In a given location, how does burn severity of the second fire relate to that of the first? (3) Do interactions between successive fires vary by forest zone or the interval between fires? (4) What factors increase the probability of burning twice as stand-replacing fire? Within the study area, 138,061 ha burned twice between 1984 and 2010. Overall, frequency distributions of burn severity classes (low, moderate, high; quantified using relativized remote sensing indices) were similar between the first and second fires; however burn severity was 5-13\% lower in second fires on average. Negative interactions between fires were most pronounced in lower-elevation forests and woodlands, when fire intervals were \textbackslash textless10 yr, and when burn severity was low in the first fire. When the first fire burned as high severity and fire intervals exceeded 10-12 yr, burn-severity interactions switched from negative to positive, with high-severity fire begetting subsequent high-severity fire. Locations most likely to experience successive stand-replacing fires were high-elevation forests, which are adapted to high-severity fire, and areas conducive to abundant post-fire tree regeneration. Broadly similar severities among short-interval "re- burns" and other wildfires indicate that positive severity feedbacks, an oft-posited agent of ecosystem decline or state shift, are not an inevitable outcome of re- burning. Nonetheless, context-dependent shifts in both the magnitude and direction of wildfire interactions (associated with forest zone, initial burn-severity, and disturbance interval) illustrate complexities in disturbance interactions and can inform management and predictions of future system dynamics.},

  abstract = {The "Practice of Silviculture" has been prepared for use as a text book to cover a field at present unfilled. So far as is known there is no recent book applicable to the forests of this continent covering the field of silviculture. Graves' ''Principles of Handling Woodlands," published in 1911, and Schlich's "Manual of Forestry," Vols. I and II, revised in 1895 are practically the only works on the subject in the English language. Government and state publications contain, in more or less fragmentary form, a large store of knowledge concerning the practice of silviculture. Forest Terminology in the Appendix is copied verbatim from the Journal of Forestry, Vol. XV, 1917, published by the Society of American Foresters. The author does not claim originality for the greater part of the information. Available sources have been investigated and a selection and compilation made of such information as is deemed most useful to-day. Presentation of the subject is from the standpoint of the teacher and the arrangement and discussion are shaped in a manner which it is believed will be clear to the student. A possible criticism in connection with some parts of the book is that the treatment of the subject is too theoretical. In answer to this it may be said that the writer realizes, from fifteen years' experience in applying silviculture on forest properties and in teaching the subject, that, while, in the application of silviculture, methods as given in books often must be so modified and changed to fit local conditions as to be scarcely recognizable, yet, for best results in teaching students, definite theories and methods must be elaborated and set off distinctly one from the other. No attempt has been made to cover in an absolutely complete way and with full detail all branches of applied silviculture. Such a work can well be postponed another decade until American silviculture progresses further through the formative period. On the contrary the purpose has been to keep the text brief with the idea of producing a work to fill an immediate need, containing such information as appears applicable to-day or likely to be applicable (at least in some parts of the country) in the near future.

However, current ecosystem models do not track the effects of root disease on net productivity, and there has been little research on how the dynamics of root disease affect carbon (C) storage and productivity across infected landscapes. We compared the effects of root disease against the effects of other types of forest disturbance across six national forest landscapes, 1990-2011. This was enabled by a monitoring tool called the Forest Carbon Management Framework (ForCaMF), which makes use of ground inventory data, an empirical growth model, and time series of Landsat satellite imagery. Despite several large fires that burned across these landscapes during the study period, retrospective ForCaMF analysis showed that fire and root disease had approximately equal impacts on C storage. Relative to C accumulation that would have occurred in their absence, fires from 1990 to 2011 were estimated to reduce regionwide C storage by 215.3 {$\pm$} 19.1 g/m2 C, while disease in the same period was estimated to reduce storage by 211.4 {$\pm$} 59.9 g/m2 C. Harvest (75.5 {$\pm$} 13.5 g/m2 C) and bark beetle activity (14.8 {$\pm$} 12.5 g/m2 C) were less important. While long-term disturbance processes such as root disease have generally been ignored by tools informing management of forest C storage, the recent history of several national forests suggests that such disturbances can be just as important to the C cycle as more conspicuous events like wildfires.},

  abstract = {Boreal ecosystems and their large carbon stocks are strongly shaped by extensive wildfires. Coupling climate projections with records of area burned during the last 3 decades across the North American boreal zone suggests that area burned will increase by 30-500\% by the end of the 21st century, with a cascading effect on ecosystem dynamics and on the boreal carbon balance. Fire size and the frequency of large-fire years are both expected to increase. However, how fire size and time since previous fire will influence future burn rates is poorly understood, mostly because of incomplete records of past fire overlaps. Here, we reconstruct the length of overlapping fires along a 190-km-long transect during the last 200 y in one of the most fire-prone boreal regions of North America to document how fire size and time since previous fire will influence future fire recurrence. We provide direct field evidence that extreme burn rates can be sustained by a few occasional droughts triggering immense fires. However, we also show that the most fire-prone areas of the North American boreal forest are resistant to high burn rates because of overabundant young forest stands, thereby creating a fuel-mediated negative feedback on fire activity. These findings will help refine projections of fire effect on boreal ecosystems and their large carbon stocks.},

We compared landscape patterns, vegetation structure and composition, and landscape vulnerability to 21 major forest insect and pathogen disturbances of historical and current forest vegetation coverages. Forest vegetation composition, structure, and patterns were derived from attributes interpreted and mapped from aerial photographs taken from 1932 to 1966 (historical), and from 1981 to 1993 (current). Areas with homogeneous vegetation composition and structure were delineated as patches to a minimum size of 4 ha. Results of change analyses were reported for province-scale ecological reporting units (ERU's). In this paper, we report on methods used to characterize historical and current patch and subwatershed vulnerability to each of 21 insect and pathogen disturbance agents. We assessed landscape vulnerability to defoliator, bark beetle, dwarf mistletoe, root disease, blister rust, and stem decay disturbances. We used patch composition, structure, logging disturbance, and physical environment attributes to compare vegetation vulnerability of historical subwatersheds with that of their current condition. Patch vulnerability factors included items such as site quality, host abundance, canopy layers, host age or host size, patch vigor, patch (stand) density, connectivity of host patches, topographic setting, and presence of visible logging disturbance. Methods reported here can be used in landscape or watershed analysis to evaluate or monitor change in the magnitude and spatial pattern of vegetation vulnerability to insect and pathogen disturbances, and in planning to compare potential disturbance futures associated with alternative vegetation management scenarios.},

  abstract = {Resilience and resistance concepts have broad application to ecology and society. Resilience is an emergent property that reflects the amount of disruption a system can withstand before its structure or organization uncharacteristically shift. Resistance is a component of resilience. Before the advent of intensive forest management and fire suppression, western North American forests exhibited a naturally occurring resilience to wildfires and other disturbances. Using evidence from ten ecoregions, spanning forests from Canada to Mexico, we review the properties of these forests that reinforced those qualities. We show examples of multi-level landscape resilience, of feedbacks within and among levels, and how conditions have changed under climatic and management influences. We highlight geographic similarities and differences in the structure and organization of historical landscapes, their forest types, and in the conditions that have changed resilience and resistance to abrupt or large-scale disruptions. We discuss the regional climates' role in episodically or abruptly reorganizing plant and animal biogeography, and forest resilience and resistance to disturbances. We give clear examples of these changes and suggest that managing for resilient forests is a construct that is strongly dependent on scale and social values. It involves human community adaptations that work with the ecosystems they depend on and the processes that shape them. It entails actively managing factors and exploiting mechanisms that drive dynamics at each level as means of adapting landscapes, species, and human communities to climate change, and maintaining core ecosystem functions, processes, and services. Finally, it compels us to prioritize management that incorporates ongoing disturbances and anticipated effects of climatic changes, to support dynamically shifting patchworks of forest and nonforest. Doing so will make these shifting forest conditions and wildfire regimes more gradual and less disruptive to individuals and society.},

We describe the relationship between fire occurrence and interannual to decadal climatic variability (Palmer Drought Severity Index [PDSI], El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation [ENSO], and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation [PDO]) and explain how land use changes in the 20th century affected these relationships. We used 1701 fire-scarred trees collected in five study sites in central and eastern Washington State (USA) to investigate current year, lagged, and low frequency relationships between composite fire histories and PDSI, PDO, and ENSO (using the Southern Oscillation Index [SOI] as a measure of ENSO variability) using superposed epoch analysis and cross-spectral analysis. Fires tended to occur during dry summers and during the positive phase of the PDO. Cross-spectral analysis indicates that percentage of trees scarred by fire and the PDO are spectrally coherent at 47 years, the approximate cycle of the PDO. Similarly, percentage scarred and ENSO are spectrally coherent at six years, the approximate cycle of ENSO. However, other results suggest that ENSO was only a weak driver of fire occurrence in the past three centuries. While drought and fire appear to be tightly linked between 1700 and 1900, the relationship between drought and fire occurrence was disrupted during the 20th century as a result of land use changes. We suggest that long-term fire planning using the PDO may be possible in the Pacific Northwest, potentially allowing decadal-scale management of fire regimes, prescribed fire, and vegetation dynamics.},

During our analysis period (1650-1900), we reconstructed fires from 9245 fire scars on 576 trees (mostly ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa P. \& C. Lawson) at 21 sites and compared them to existing tree-ring reconstructions of climate (temperature and the Palmer Drought Severity Index [PDSI]) and large-scale climate patterns that affect modern spring climate in this region (El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation [ENSO] and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation [PDO]). We identified 32 regional-fire years as those with five or more sites with fire. Fires were remarkably widespread during such years, including one year (1748) in which fires were recorded at 10 sites across what are today seven national forests plus one site on state land. During regional-fire years, spring-summers were significantly warm and summers were significantly warm-dry whereas the opposite conditions prevailed during the 99 years when no fires were recorded at any of our sites (no-fire years). Climate in prior years was not significantly associated with regional- or no-fire years. Years when fire was recorded at only a few of our sites occurred under a broad range of climate conditions, highlighting the fact that the regional climate drivers of fire are most evident when fires are synchronized across a large area. No-fire years tended to occur during La Ni\~na years, which tend to have anomalously deep snowpacks in this region. However, ENSO was not a significant driver of regional-fire years, consistent with the greater influence of La Ni\~na than El Ni\~no conditions on the spring climate of this region. PDO was not a significant driver of past fire, despite being a strong driver of modern spring climate and modern regional-fire years in the northern Rockies. \textcopyright{} 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract = {Insect outbreaks are significant disturbances in forests of the western United States, with infestation comparable in area to fire. Outbreaks of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) require life cycles of one year with synchronous emergence of adults from host trees at an appropriate time of year (termed "adaptive seasonality") to overwhelm tree defenses. The annual course of temperature plays a major role in governing life stage development and imposing synchrony on mountain pine beetle populations. Here we apply a process-based model of adaptive seasonality across the western United States using gridded daily temperatures from the Vegetation/Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis Project (VEMAP) over the period 1895-2100. Historical locations of modeled adaptive seasonality overlay much of the distribution of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas), a favored host, indicating that suitable temperatures for outbreak occurred in areas of host availability. A range of suitable temperatures, both in the mean and over an annual cycle, resulted in adaptive seasonality. Adaptive seasonality typically occurred when mean annual temperatures were 3\textdegree -6\textdegree C, but also included locations where mean temperatures were as low as 1\textdegree C or as high as 11\textdegree C, primarily as a result of variability in winter temperatures. For most locations, years of adaptive seasonality were uncommon during 1895-1993. We analyzed historical temperatures and adaptive seasonality in more detail in three northern forest ecoprovinces. In the Northern and Middle Rockies, areas of adaptive seasonality decreased at lower elevations and increased at higher elevations during warmer periods, resulting in a movement upward in elevation of adaptive seasonality. In contrast, the Cascade Mountains exhibited overall declines in adaptive seasonality with higher temperatures regardless of elevation. Projections of future warming (5\textdegree C in the western United States) resulted in substantial reductions in the overall area of adaptive seasonality. At the highest elevations, predicted warmer conditions will result in increases in the area of adaptive seasonality. Our findings suggest that future climate change may alter forest ecosystems indirectly through alteration of these important disturbances. Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.}

In this study, we reviewed and synthesized the published literature on modifications to fuels and fire characteristics following beetle-caused tree mortality. We found 39 studies addressing this topic with a variety of methods including fuels measurements, fire behavior simulations, an experiment, and observations of fire occurrence, severity, or frequency. From these publications, we developed a conceptual framework describing expected changes of fuels and fire behavior. Some characteristics of fuels and fire are enhanced following outbreaks and others are unchanged or diminished, with time since outbreak a key factor influencing changes. We also quantified areas of higher and lower confidence in our framework based on the number of studies addressing a particular area as well as agreement among studies. The published literature agrees about responses in many conditions, including fuels measurements and changes in stands with longer times since outbreak, and so we assigned higher confidence to our conceptual framework for these conditions. Disagreement or gaps in knowledge exist in several conditions, particularly in early postoutbreak phases and crown fire behavior responses, leading to low confidence in our framework in these areas and highlighting the need for future research. Our findings resolved some of the controversy about effects of bark beetles on fire through more specificity about time since outbreak and fuels or fire characteristic. Recognition of the type of study question was also important in resolving controversy: some publications assessed whether beetle-caused tree mortality caused differences relative to unattacked locations, whereas other publications assessed differences relative to other drivers of wildfire such as climate. However, some disagreement among studies remained. Given the large areas of recent bark beetle and wildfire disturbances and expected effects of climate change, land and fire managers need more confidence in key areas when making decisions about treatments to reduce future fire hazard and when fighting fires. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Despite being a major contributor of mortality in forests of western North America, particularly in the northern Rocky Mountains in the United States, little is known about the underlying factors that influence root disease occurrence and severity at landscape and broader scales. We used a database with \textbackslash textgreater15,000 geographically-distributed, spatially-referenced root disease assessments from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots from across the US Northern Rocky mountains and high resolution (30 m) climate and soil-water balance grids to examine climatic and biophysical factors associated with presence and severity of root disease. We used a two-stage modeling approach that combined boosted regression-tree models and residual kriging to predict the probability of occurrence and severity of root disease across the area of analysis. A best-fit model explained root disease occurrence moderately well (AUC = 0.77) and included average annual dewpoint temperature, evapotranspiration and climatic water deficit. Root disease occurrence was associated with moist, humid sites subject to low or moderate climatic water deficits. Root disease severity was not well explained by climatic and biophysical factors alone (R2 = 0.19). Residual kriging only marginally improved model fit (R2 = 0.20). We used the fitted models to produce 30 m resolution gridded root disease occurrence and severity maps across the US Forest Service Northern Region for use in broad-scale planning and analysis. Weak spatial autocorrelation at distances beyond 5 km and relatively low accuracy of the severity model suggests that the FIA plot distribution is not suited to predict spatial patterns of root disease severity. Additional factors related to root disease severity, such as vegetation type and site-specific disturbance histories, are likely needed for fine-scale severity predictions.},

Combined analysis of Ground Temperature (GT) measurements at two high-fidelity boreholes with Surface Air Temperature (SAT) measurements near Helena Montana spanning the past 40 years indicate the northern US Rockies have warmed on average 0.12\textdegree C - 0.32\textdegree C/decade since 1975, at least a factor of {$\sim$}5 higher than the predicted 500-year-average. Warming appears to be accelerating, with warming rates since 2013 4 - 7 times higher than the 40 year average. Though uncertainty exists, the most significant GT warming appears to occur at higher elevation. Warming estimates are consistent with modelling predictions, snowpack observations, and stream temperature studies, all suggesting rapid surface temperature change in this region during the past {$\sim$}40 years. The analysis indicates GT warming measured at remote borehole sites is slightly lower than regional SAT measurements collected near urban environments. We associate the discrepancy between GT/SAT measurements to both anthropogenic effects (urban development) that increase warming at the nearest SAT measurement station and a 14-year period of anomalously low snowfall that reduces surface insulation and GT warming. Using a derived average forty-year surface warming rate of 0.22\textdegree C/ decade and regional temperature-elevation trends, we calculate that the elevation of the winter freeze line during the three coldest months of the year (December, January, and February) in the northern US Rocky Mountains is retreating upward, on average, 33 m/decade. This implies a 21\% reduction in freeze-line area since 1974. If this trend continues, we estimate that within the next 40 years (by 2060), the total area where ground freeze occurs during the three coldest months of the year will be {$\sim$}60\% of 1974 values. Since GT measurements indicate accelerated warming, this may be an underestimate. The analysis has important implications for the snowpack-water budget for Montana and the northern US Rocky Mountains.},

After large fire years, managers prioritize where to allocate scarce planting resources, often with limited information on the factors that drive successful forest establishment. Where occurring, long-term effects of postfire salvage operations can increase uncertainty of establishment. Here, we collected field data on postfire regeneration patterns within 13- to 28-yr-old burned patches in eastern Washington State. Across 248 plots, we sampled tree stems \textexclamdown 4 m height using a factorial design that considered (1) fire severity, moderate vs. high severity; (2) salvage harvesting, salvaged vs. no management; and (3) potential vegetation type (PVT), sample resides in a dry, moist, or cold mixed-conifer forest environment. We found that regeneration was abundant throughout the study region, with a median of 4414 (IQR 19,618) stems/ha across all plots. Only 15\% of plots fell below minimum timber production stocking standards (350 trees/ha), and \textexclamdown 2\% of plots were unstocked. Densities were generally highest in high-severity patches and following salvage harvesting, although high variability among plots and across sites led to variable significance for these factors. Post hoc analyses suggested that mild postfire weather conditions may have reduced water stress on tree establishment and early growth, contributing to overall high stem densities. Douglas fir was the most abundant species, particularly in moderate-severity patches, followed by ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, western larch, and Engelmann spruce. Generalized additive models (GAMs) revealed species-level climatic tolerances and seed dispersal limits that portend future challenges to regeneration with expected future climate warming and increased fire activity. Postfire regeneration will occur on sites with adequate seed sources within their climatic tolerances.},

  abstract = {Given that resource managers rely on computer simulation models when it is difficult or expensive to obtain vital information directly, it is important to evaluate how well a particular model satisfies applications for which it is designed. The Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) is used widely for forest management in the US, and its scope and complexity continue to increase. This paper focuses on the accuracy of estimates made by the Fire and Fuels Extension (FFE-FVS) predictions through comparisons between model outputs and measured post-fire conditions for the Cold Springs wildfire and on the sensitivity of model outputs to weather, disease, and fuel inputs. For each set of projected, pre-fire stand conditions, a fire was simulated that approximated the actual conditions of the Cold Springs wildfire as recorded by local portable weather stations. We also simulated a fire using model default values. From the simulated post-fire conditions, values of tree mortality and fuel loads were obtained for comparison to post-fire, observed values. We designed eight scenarios to evaluate how model output changed with varying input values for three parameter sets of interest: fire weather, disease, and fuels. All of the tested model outputs displayed some sensitivity to alternative model inputs. Our results indicate that tree mortality and fuels were most sensitive to whether actual or default weather was used and least sensitive to whether or not disease data were included as model inputs. The performance of FFE-FVS for estimating total surface fuels was better for the scenarios using actual weather data than for the scenarios using default weather data. It was rare that the model could predict fine fuels or litter. Our results suggest that using site-specific information over model default values could significantly improve the accuracy of simulated values. \textcopyright{} 2012.},

Comparisons between the actual and predicted mortality over a 5-year period for 2 sets of permanent sample plot data demonstrate that the method (with mean dbh as predictor) can be used with confidence for estimating future mortality. Percentage distribution of dead trees by dbh class is found to be approximately normal. Number of dead trees for each dbh class can be estimated using a normal distribution.

Species life-history traits represent an adaptive response to disturbance and are an information legacy; in contrast, the abiotic and biotic structures (such as seeds or nutrients) produced by single disturbance events are material legacies. Disturbance characteristics that support or maintain these legacies enhance ecological resilience and maintain a ``safe operating space'' for ecosystem recovery. However, legacies can be lost or diminished as disturbance regimes and environmental conditions change, generating a ``resilience debt'' that manifests only after the system is disturbed. Strong effects of ecological memory on post-disturbance dynamics imply that contingencies (effects that cannot be predicted with certainty) of individual disturbances, interactions among disturbances, and climate variability combine to affect ecosystem resilience. We illustrate these concepts and introduce a novel ecosystem resilience framework with examples of forest disturbances, primarily from North America. Identifying legacies that support resilience in a particular ecosystem can help scientists and resource managers anticipate when disturbances may trigger abrupt shifts in forest ecosystems, and when forests are likely to be resilient.}

  abstract = {After a century of fire suppression, conifer forests in the western United States have dramatically departed from conditions that existed prior to Euro-American settlement, with heavy fuel loads and an increased incidence of wildfire. To reduce this threat and improve overall forest health, land managers are designing landscape-scale treatments that strategically locate thinning and burning treatments to disrupt fuel continuity, allowing managed wildfires to burn the remaining area. A necessary step in designing and evaluating these treatments is understanding their ecological effects on wildlife. We used meta-analysis to compare effects of small-diameter removal (thinnings and shelterwoods) and burning treatments, selective harvesting, overstory removal (including clearcutting), and wildfire on wildlife species in southwestern conifer forests. We hypothesized that small-diameter removal and burning treatments would have minimal effects on wildlife compared to other treatments. We found 33 studies that met our criteria by (1) comparing density or reproductive output for wildlife species, (2) using forest management or wildfire treatments, (3) implementing control-impact or before-after control-impact design using unmanaged stands as controls, and (4) occurring in Arizona or New Mexico ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) or mixed conifer (Abies/Picea/Pinus) forest. The 22 studies suitable for meta-analysis occurred {$\leq$}20 years post-treatment on sites \textbackslash textless400 ha. Small-diameter harvest and burning treatments had positive effects but thin/burn and selective harvest treatments had no detectable effect on most small mammals and passerine bird species reported in studies; overstory removal and wildfire resulted in an overall negative response. We examined foraging guild responses to treatments; ground-foraging birds and rodents had no strong response. Aerial-, tree-, and bole-foraging birds had positive or neutral responses to the small-diameter removal and burning treatments, but negative responses to overstory removal and wildfire. Small-diameter removal and burning treatments as currently being implemented in the Southwest do not negatively impact most of the wildlife species in the studies we examined in the short-term ({$\leq$}10 years). We believe a combination of treatments in a patchy arrangement across the landscape will result in the highest diversity and density. We recommend that managers implement thinning and burning treatments, but that future research efforts focus on long-term responses of species at larger spatial scales, use reproductive output as a more informative response variable, and target species for which there is a paucity of data. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Also modelled are live and dead fuel accumulations, fire behavior, fuel reduction, and insect and disease mortality. The following influences on tree establishment and growth are simulated in the model: temperature, water stress, site quality, and light conditions. An additional submodel in firesum simulates the mutualistic relationship between the Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) and the whitebark pine. Seed caches made by the Clark's nutcracker are evidently responsible for most whitebark pine regeneration. Whitebark pine seeds are also an important food for red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), black bear (Ursus americana), and especially grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis). Infestations of white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) and mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and successional replacement by shade-tolerant conifers can reduce whitebark pine populations, which can adversely impact dependent wildlife species. The model firesum was used to investigate the effects of fire, insects, and disease on whitebark pine regeneration and growth. Model predictions of basal area by tree species are presented for contrasting disturbance scenarios. Simulation predictions indicate severe reduction in some whitebark pine populations if current trends are not altered.

However, most gap model emphasize, in terms of process detail, computer code, and validation effort, tree growth with little attention to the simulation of plant death or mortality. Mortality algorithms have been mostly limited to general relationships because of sparse data on the causal mechanisms of mortality. If gap models are to be used to explore community dynamics under changing climates, the limitations and shortcomings of these mortality algorithms must be identified and the simulation of mortality must be improved. In this paper, we review the treatment of mortality in gap models, evaluate the relationships used to represent mortality in the current generation of gap models, and then assess the prospects for making improvements, especially for applications involving global climate change. Three needs are identified to improve mortality simulations in gap models: (1) process-based empirical analyses are needed to create more climate-sensitive stochastic mortality functions, (2) fundamental research is required to quantify the biophysical relationships between mortality and plant dynamics, and (3) extensive field data are needed to quantify, parameterize, and validate existing and future gap model mortality functions.}

The earliest changes will be at ecotones between lifeforms (e.g., upper and lower treelines). Ecological disturbance, including wildfire and insect outbreaks, will be the primary facilitator of vegetation change, and future forest landscapes may be dominated by younger age classes and smaller trees. High-elevation forests will be especially vulnerable if disturbance frequency increases significantly. Increased abundance and distribution of non-native plant species, as well as the legacy of past land uses, create additional stress for regeneration of native forest species. Most strategies for conserving native tree, shrub, and grassland systems focus on increasing resilience to chronic low soil moisture, and to more frequent and extensive ecological disturbance. These strategies generally include managing landscapes to reduce the severity and patch size of disturbances, encouraging fire to play a more natural role, and protecting refugia where fire-sensitive species can persist. Increasing species, genetic, and landscape diversity (spatial pattern, structure) is an important ``hedge your bets'' strategy that will reduce the risk of major forest loss. Adaptation tactics include using silvicultural prescriptions (especially stand density management) and fuel treatments to reduce fuel continuity, reducing populations of nonnative species, potentially using multiple genotypes in reforestation, and revising grazing policies and practices. Rare and disjunct species and communities (e.g., whitebark pine, quaking aspen) require adaptation strategies and tactics focused on encouraging regeneration, preventing damage from disturbance, and establishing refugia.},

Predicted peak coarse and fine woody fuels were not sensitive to the decomposition rate of snags but were sensitive to decomposition rate of surface fuels regardless of initial snag density. Predictions of coarse woody fuel were sensitive to the snag fall rate when there was a higher initial density of snags. Fire behavior predictions were most sensitive to whether stylized fuel models or modeled fuels were used in calculations. When modeled fuels were used, fire behavior predictions were sensitive to the decomposition rate of surface fuels.

We assembled a dataset from public and private land management organizations that allowed us to test the role of ecological variables on modifying maximum stand density frontiers. Maximum stand density frontier models were built for selected conifer species using stochastic frontier regression. The influence of species mixing was assessed by including as a covariate basal area proportion of the three conifer species of interest in this study: Pinus ponderosa var. ponderosa, Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca, and Abies grandis var. idahoensis. A single, parsimonious model was found to fit each species, with variable coefficients reflecting species adaptation to varying abiotic site factors across the region. Site factors that increased maximum density included cool, moist conditions, soils containing volcanic ash over coarse-textured bedrock, and high tree-species diversity. These observations correspond to regional silvicultural guidance, thereby providing both a site-sensitive, quantitative maximum density measure for mixed species stands, and a tool for evaluating the effect of climate scenarios on future stand carrying capacity.},

  abstract = {The generalization that plant communities increase in flammability as they age and invariably lead to resilient self-organized landscape mosaics is being increasingly challenged. Plant communities often exhibit rapidly saturating or even hump-shaped age-flammability trajectories and landscapes often display strong non-linear behaviors, abrupt shifts, and self-reinforcing alternative community states. This plethora of fire-landscape interactions calls for a more general model that considers alternative age-flammability rules. We simulated landscape dynamics assuming communities that (1) increase in flammability with age and (2) gain flammability up to a certain age followed by a slight and moderate loss to a constant value. Simulations were run under combinations of ignition frequency and interannual climatic variability. Age-increasing fire probability promoted high resilience to changes in ignition frequency and climatic variability whereas humpbacked-shaped age-flammability led to strong non-linear behaviors. Moderate (20\%) reductions in mature compared to peak flammability produced the least resilient behaviors. The relatively non-flammable mature forest matrix intersected by young flammable patches is prone to break up and disintegrate with slight increases in ignition/climate variability causing large-scale shifts in the fire regime because large fires were able to sweep through the more continuous young/flammable landscape. Contrary to the dominant perception, fire suppression in landscapes with positive feedbacks may effectively reduce fire occurrence by allowing less flammable later stage communities composed of longer lived, obligate seeders to replace earlier stages of light demanding, often more flammable resprouters. Conversely, increases in anthropogenic ignitions, a common global trend of many forested regions may, in synergism with increased climate variability, induce abrupt shifts, and large-scale forest degradation. \textcopyright{} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

In this context, our paper focuses on how an assisted migration policy for western larch has been developed in British Columbia, Canada, specifically examining institutional change at three different levels of policy ideas and in discourses oriented internally or externally in the policy process. Based on 46 interviews with policy actors across Canada, our results suggest that the deployment of the first assisted migration policy in Canada successfully avoided the controversy surrounding the idea in the scientific community by changing the scientific discourse associated with best forest management practices. The shift from an ecological discourse to a genetics discourse over forest policy in British Columbia signals what we might expect in future forest adaptation policy development in Canada.},

We performed a factorial experiment on 48 mature ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa) in northern Arizona over three years that manipulated a) tree water stress by cutting roots and removing snow; b) bark beetle attacks by using pheromone lures; and c) phloem exposure to biota vectored by bark beetles by inoculating with dead beetles. Tree responses included resin flow from stem wounds, phloem composition of mono- and sesqui-terpenes, xylem water potential, leaf gas exchange, and survival. Phloem contained 21 mono- and sesqui-terpenes, which were dominated by (+)-{$\alpha$}-pinene, (-)-limonene, and {$\delta$}-3-carene. Bark beetle attacks (mostly Dendroctonus brevicomis) and biota carried by beetles induced a general increase in concentration of phloem mono- and sesqui-terpenes, whereas water stress did not. Bark beetle attacks induced an increase in resin flow for unstressed trees but not water-stressed trees. Mortality was highest for beetle-attacked water-stressed trees. Death of beetle-attacked trees was preceded by low resin flow, symptoms of water stress (low xylem water potential, leaf gas exchange), and an ephemeral increase in concentrations of mono- and sesqui-terpenes compared to surviving trees. These results show a) that ponderosa pine can undergo induction of both resin flow and phloem terpenes in response to bark beetle attack, and that the former is more constrained by water stress; b) experimental evidence that water stress predisposes ponderosa pines to mortality from bark beetles.},

Analyses were based on relationships between monthly global wildfire activity, soil moisture, and mid-tropospheric circulation data from 2001 to 2007, synthesized across a gradient of long-term averages in resources (net primary productivity), annual temperature, and terrestrial biome. We demonstrate support for the varying constraints hypothesis, showing that, while key biophysical factors must coincide for wildfires to occur, the relative influence of resources to burn and moisture/weather conditions on fire activity shows predictable spatial patterns. In areas where resources are always available for burning during the fire season, such as subtropical/tropical biomes with mid-high annual long-term net primary productivity, fuel moisture conditions exert their strongest constraint on fire activity. In areas where resources are more limiting or variable, such as deserts, xeric shrublands, or grasslands/savannas, fuel moisture has a diminished constraint on wildfire, and metrics indicating availability of burnable fuels produced during the antecedent wet growing seasons reflect a more pronounced constraint on wildfire. This macro-scaled evidence for spatially varying constraints provides a synthesis with studies performed at local and regional scales, enhances our understanding of fire as a global process, and indicates how sensitivity to future changes in temperature and precipitation may differ across the world. \textcopyright{} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Between 1997 and 2002 extensive areas of subalpine forests in northwestern Colorado were affected by a blowdown of trees, bark beetle outbreaks, and salvage logging. Some of these stands were also affected by severe fires in the late 19th century. During a severe drought in 2002, fires affected extensive areas of these subalpine forests. We evaluated and modeled the extent and severity of the 2002 fires in relation to these disturbances that occurred over the five years prior to the fires and in relation to late 19th century stand-replacing fires. Occurrence of disturbances prior to 2002 was reconstructed using a combination of tree-ring methods, aerial photograph interpretation, field surveys, and geographic information systems (GIS). The extent and severity of the 2002 fires were based on the normalized difference burn ratio (NDBR) derived from satellite imagery. GIS and classification trees were used to analyze the effects of prefire conditions on the 2002 fires. Previous disturbance history had a significant influence on the severity of the 2002 fires. Stands that were severely blown down (\textbackslash textgreater66\% trees down) in 1997 burned more severely than other stands, and young ({$\sim$}120 year old) postfire stands burned less severely than older stands. In contrast, prefire disturbances were poor predictors of fire extent, except that young ({$\sim$}120 years old) postfire stands were less extensively burned than older stands. Salvage logging and bark beetle outbreaks that followed the 1997 blowdown (within the blowdown as well as in adjacent forest that was not blown down) did not appear to affect fire extent or severity. Conclusions regarding the influence of the beetle outbreaks on fire extent and severity are limited, however, by spatial and temporal limitations associated with aerial detection surveys of beetle activity. Thus, fire extent in these forests is largely independent of prefire disturbance history and vegetation conditions. In contrast, fire severity, even during extreme fire weather and in conjunction with a multiyear drought, is influenced by prefire stand conditions, including the history of previous disturbances. \textcopyright{} 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Existing models, linking control rate to beetle population dynamics and tree infestations, give insights, but there is a need to take into account the environment spatial variability and its impact on beetle life cycle. Here, we use natural variability found in a carefully monitored and controlled infestation to simulate outbreak dynamics under different control effort and to explore the impact of control on outbreaks suppression and tree mortality. Our semi-empirical predictive model of the number of infested trees as a function of ecological and environmental variables is coupled to a simulation model for infestation dynamics. We show that even a little control can have a major impact on the number of infested trees after several years of sustained effort. However, a moderate control of 60\% is required to reduce the beetle population on the long term. Furthermore, a control rate of 69\%\textendash 83\% is needed to achieve outbreak suppression in under 13 years depending on the abundance of incoming flights from outside sources.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a stand growth model, based on physiological processes, which incorporates a number of steps and procedures that have allowed considerable simplification relative to extant process based models. The model, called 3-PG (use of Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth), calculates total carbon fixed (gross primary production; P(G)) from utilizable, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation ({$\phi$}(p.a.u)), obtained by correcting the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the forest canopy ({$\phi$}(p.a.)) for the effects of soil drought, atmospheric vapour pressure deficits and stand age. P(G) is obtained from {$\phi$}(p.a.u) and the canopy quantum efficiency, values of which are becoming available. The ratio of net (P(N)) to gross primary production is emerging as relatively constant for trees. This eliminates the need to calculate respiration and is used to estimate P(N)-the net amount of carbon converted to biomass. 3-PG uses a simple relationship to estimate the amount of carbon allocated below ground and a procedure based on allometric ratios-widely available for many species and situations to determine the allocation of carbon to foliage and stems and constrain tree growth patterns. The effects of nutrition are incorporated through the carbon allocation procedure; the amount of carbon allocated below ground will increase with decreasing soil fertility. Recently acquired knowledge about the physiological factors causing decline in forest growth rates with age is used to model that decline. Changes in stem populations (self-thinning) are derived from a procedure based on the -3/2 power law, combined with stem growth rates. The model requires weather data as input, works on monthly time steps and has been run for periods up to 120 years, producing realistic patterns of stem growth and stern diameter increments. The time course of leaf area index is realistic for a range of soil conditions and atmospheric constraints. 3-PG can be run from remotely-sensed estimates of leaf area index coupled to weather data and basic, readily available information about soils and stand characteristics. It is being tested as a practical tool against forestry data from New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and New Zealand. Test results show excellent correspondence between stand growth measurements and simulated stem growth over 30 years.},

To assess these effects, climate-tree growth relationships of pure Abies alba stands were compared to those of three different mixtures: A. alba with Fagus sylvatica, with Picea abies and with both species. 151 stands (456 A. alba trees) were sampled in the Vosges mountains in north-eastern France under three contrasted climates, from low altitude and dry conditions (mean precipitation in July \textbackslash textless85. mm and altitude \textbackslash textless600. m) to high altitude and humid conditions (P July \textbackslash textgreater115. mm and alt. \textbackslash textless900. m). We sampled adult trees and homogeneous stand conditions to clearly assess differences in sensitivity to climate. Climate-tree growth relationships were evaluated from 12 A. alba chronologies (four mixtures. \texttimes. three climatic conditions) through pointer years and response function analyses. Late previous summer conditions and current summer soil water deficit and temperature played a major role on A. alba growth. Results showed greater sensitivity to temperature at high elevation, and to summer drought at low altitude and under dry conditions. Mixture allowed maintaining a higher level of A. alba growth during extreme climatic events and reduced A. alba response to summer drought especially under the driest contexts. Different facilitation processes may explain mixture effects such as changes in rooting depth, water input by stemflow and rainfall interception. This differentiated functioning of mixed forests highlights their importance for adapting forest management to climate change. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper we discuss temporal and spatial heterogeneity in fire regimes along with heterogeneity internal to individual fires. We examine how these sources of variability challenge our ability to make inferences from the kind of data typically available in empirical studies. We built a simple, spatially explicit, stochastic simulation, based on a Poisson model of fire occurrence, and used it to create a series of scenarios that differ in their assumptions about variability in fire interval, size, and shape. Our purpose was to produce data sets similar to those collected in the f ield. However, we are able to assess the effectiveness of standard methods for analyzing such data because we have perfect knowledge of the dynamics and variables driving the fire regimes. Our analyses demonstrate that the reconstructed parameters of a fire regime can exhibit substantial variability, even in the absence of an underlying ecological or physical pattern. Consequently, we recommend caution in attributing causality to apparent temporal or spatial differences in fire regime parameters that are not motivated by independently generated hypotheses. Furthermore, modest temporal variability in fire frequency can induce significant fluctuations in forest age structure over time, calling in to question inferences that assume a steady-state age distribution. Our discussion highlights the irnportance of heterogeneity in forest landscapes, the need to understand the lirnits of our analytical methods, and the challenges of incorporating these ideas into management.},

The aim of this study was to quantify the landscape-level drivers that explained the dynamic patterns of MPB mortality, and simulate areas with future potential MPB mortality under projected climate-change scenarios in Grand County, Colorado, USA. The outbreak patterns of MPB were characterized by analysis of a decade-long Landsat time-series stack, aided by automatic attribution of change detected by the Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery algorithm (LandTrendr). The annual area of new MPB mortality was then related to a suite of anthropogenic, biologic, and physical predictor variables under a general linear model (GLM) framework. Data from years 2001-2005 were used to train the model and data from years 2006-2011 were retained for validation. After stepwise removal of non-significant predictors, the remaining predictors in the GLM indicated that neighborhood mortality, winter mean temperature anomaly, and residential housing density were positively associated with MPB mortality, whereas summer precipitation was negatively related. The final model had an average area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic plot value of 0.72 in predicting the annual area of new mortality for the independent validation years, and the mean deviation from the base maps in the MPB mortality areal estimates was around 5\%. The extent of MPB mortality will likely expand under two climate-change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) in Grand County, which implies that the impacts of MPB outbreaks on vegetation composition and structure, and ecosystem functioning are likely to increase in the future.},

We introduce a macroscopic parameter called the "shade tolerance index" and compare it to the classic continuum index in southern Wisconsin forests. We exemplify shade tolerance driven succession in White Pine-Eastern Hemlock forests using computer simulations and analyzing approximated chronosequence data from the USDA FIA forest inventory. We describe this parameter across the last 50 years in the ecoregions of mainland USA, and demonstrate that it does not correlate with the usual macroscopic characteristics of stand age, biomass, basal area, and biodiversity measures. We characterize the dynamics of shade tolerance index using transition matrices and delimit geographical areas based on the relevance of shade tolerance to explain forest succession. We conclude that shade tolerance driven succession is linked to climatic variables and can be considered as a primary driving factor of forest dynamics mostly in central-north and northeastern areas in the USA.

Abundance of understory plants, especially herbs, appeared to increase dramatically in the thinned stands. The moss layer was significantly more abundant in old-growth stands than in the young pine stands. Of a total of 108 species sampled, only three were introduced species, all of which occurred more frequently in the low-density stands than in any of the other stands. Thinning treatments appeared to increase the abundance of late-seral species. Our results suggest that by disrupting canopy closure, thinning decreased the dominance of tall trees and increased the abundance of herbs, shrubs, and trees in the understory height classes. As a result, thinning to low densities significantly increased the structural richness of the tree layer and caused an increase in total structural diversity, which, although only marginally significant (p = 0.06), was likely biologically important. Our results suggest that thinning will enhance the abundance, species diversity, and structural diversity of the plant community 12 to 14 years postthinning. \textcopyright{} 2006 NRC.},

  abstract = {The impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems are likely to require changes in forest planning and natural resource management. Changes in tree growth, disturbance extent and intensity, and eventually species distributions are expected. In natural resource management and planning, ecosystem models are typically used to provide a "best estimate'' about how forests might work in the future and thus guide decision-making. Ecosystem models can be used to develop forest management strategies that anticipate these changes, but limited experience with models and model output is a challenge for managers in thinking about how to address potential effects of climate change. What do decision makers need to know about climate models, ecological models used for impacts assessments, and the uncertainty in model projections in order to use model output in strategies for adaptation to climate change? We present approaches for understanding and reducing the uncertainty associated with modeling the effects of climate change on ecosystems, focusing on multi-model approaches to clarify the strengths and limits of projections and minimize vulnerability to undesirable consequences of climate change. Scientific uncertainties about changes in climate or projections of their impacts on resources do not present fundamental barriers to management and adaptation to climate change. Instead, many of these uncertainties can be controlled by characterizing their effects on models and future projections from those models. There is uncertainty in decision making that does not derive just from the complex interaction of climate and ecosystem models, but in how modeling is integrated with other aspects of the decision environment such as choice of objectives, monitoring, and approach to assessment. Adaptive management provides a hedge against uncertainty, such that climate and ecosystem models can inform decision making.},

Using a finer ecological classification and fire-relevant climate predictors, we created statistical models linking climate and wildfire area burned for ecosections, which are geographic delineations based on biophysical variables. The results indicate a gradient from purely fuel-limited (antecedent positive water balance anomalies or negative energy balance anomalies) to purely flammability-limited (negative water balance anomalies or positive energy balance anomalies) fire regimes across ecosections. Although there are other influences (such as human ignitions and management) on fire occurrence and area burned, seasonal climate significantly explains interannual fire area burned. Differences in the role of climate across ecosections are not random, and the relative dominance of climate predictors allows objective classification of ecosection climate-fire relationships. Expected future trends in area burned range from massive increases, primarily in flammability limited systems near the middle of the water balance deficit distribution, to substantial decreases, in fuel-limited nonforested systems. We predict increasing area burned in most flammability-limited systems but predict decreasing area burned in primarily fuel-limited systems with a flammability-limited (``hybrid'') component. Compared to 2030\textendash 2059 (2040s), projected area burned for 2070\textendash 2099 (2080s) increases much more in the flammability and flammability-dominated hybrid systems than those with equal control and continues to decrease in fuel-limited hybrid systems. Exceedance probabilities for historical 95th percentile fire years are larger in exclusively flammability-limited ecosections than in those with fuel controls. Filtering the projected results using a fire-rotation constraint minimizes overprojection due to static vegetation assumptions, making projections more conservative.},

This paper attempts to review and compare two major types of individual-based forest models: growth-yield and gap models. Although the two types of models share some similar features, they differ in model structure and data requirements and play several complementary roles. Growth-yield models are used by foresters to assist timber production and evaluate growth and yield of one to several commercial timber species in managed forests, while gap models are generally developed by ecologists to explore ecological mechanisms and patterns of structure and functional dynamics in natural forest ecosystems. Site-specific environmental and species information is necessary for constructing growth-yield models while gap models require species-specific biological information of individual trees and site-specific environmental data. The growth-yield models are more diverse in terms of model structure. In contrast, gap models belong to the same genealogy and later gap models are ultimately derived from the earliest one although they may vary in detail. In the future, we expect to see more individual-based hybrid models which integrate gap models with growth-yield models and ecophysiological models. As computer technology advances explosively, individual-based models could be much more efficient and user-friendly. There have existed disproportionately few individual-based models for biodiverse forests such as evergreen tropical rain forests. Development of individual-based models for tropical rain forests is more challenging and is being stimulated by new international conservation efforts. \textcopyright{} 1995.},

  abstract = {Recent world-wide episodes of tree dieback have been attributed to increasing temperatures and associated drought. Because these events are likely to become more common, improved knowledge of their cumulative effects on resilience and the ability to recover pre-disturbance conditions is important for forest management. Here we propose several indices to examine components of individual tree resilience based on tree ring growth: resistance (inverse of growth reduction during the episode), recovery (growth increase relative to the minimum growth during the episode), resilience (capacity to reach pre-episode growth levels) and relative resilience (resilience weighted by the damage incurred during the episode). Based on tree ring analyses, we analyzed historical patterns of tree resilience to successive drought-induced low growth periods in ponderosa pine trees growing in unmanaged, remote forests of the Rocky Mountains. Low-growth periods registered in tree rings were related to anomalies in the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and were attributed to drought. Independently of the impact of a specific event, subsequent growth after a single low-growth episode was related to the growth prior to the event. Growth performance differed with tree age: young trees were overall more resistant to low-growth periods, but older trees recovered better from more recent events. Regardless of tree age, recently burned sites exhibited lower post-episode growth and lower resistance and resilience than unburned ones. We found mixed evidence for the cumulative effect of past low-growth episodes: overall, greater impacts of a prior event and greater cumulative effects of past low-growth periods caused a decrease in resistance. However, we did not find a progressive decrease in resilience over time in old trees. Our results highlight the value of using a combination of estimators to evaluate the different components of resilience. Specifically, while tree responses to disturbance depend on past disturbance episodes, the response is context-specific and depends on the impact the capacity to recover after disturbance. This suggests that recent increases in forest mortality under current climate trends could relate to thresholds on specific components of resilience (resistance, recovery, resilience itself) rather than to an overall loss of resilience over time. Identifying such thresholds and their underlying mechanisms is a promising area of research with important implications for forest management. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Authors.}

Climate changes, exotic invasions, beetle outbreaks, altered fire regimes, and human activities may interact to produce landscapes that appear and function beyond historical analogs. Objectives: We used the mechanistic ecosystem-fire process model FireBGCv2 to model interactions of wildland fire, mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) under current and future climates, across three diverse study areas. Methods: We assessed changes in tree basal area as a measure of landscape response over a 300-year simulation period for the Crown of the Continent in north-central Montana, East Fork of the Bitterroot River in western Montana, and Yellowstone Central Plateau in western Wyoming, USA. Results: Interacting disturbances reduced overall basal area via increased tree mortality of host species. Wildfire decreased basal area more than beetles or rust, and disturbance interactions modeled under future climate significantly altered landscape basal area as compared with no-disturbance and current climate scenarios. Responses varied among landscapes depending on species composition, sensitivity to fire, and pathogen and beetle suitability and susceptibility. Conclusions: Understanding disturbance interactions is critical for managing landscapes because forest responses to wildfires, pathogens, and beetle attacks may offset or exacerbate climate influences, with consequences for wildlife, carbon, and biodiversity.},

These conceptualizations of stand dynamics and production ecology do not directly associate growth response to resources, such as water and nutrients; but they facilitate the use of leaf area as an integrator of the ecological processes being silviculturally manipulated. We discuss several common silvicultural practices, including early competition control, soil manipulation, thinning, and fertilization, in the context of their influence on the amount, distribution, and net efficiency of leaf area. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Here we show evidence that complementarity is contingent on tree size across large-scale climatic gradients in Europe. We compiled growth data of the 14 most dominant tree species in 32,628 permanent plots covering boreal, temperate and Mediterranean forest biomes. Niche complementarity is expected to result in significant growth increments of trees surrounded by a larger proportion of functionally dissimilar neighbours. Functional dissimilarity at the tree level was assessed using four functional types: i.e. broad-leaved deciduous, broad-leaved evergreen, needle-leaved deciduous and needle-leaved evergreen. Using Linear Mixed Models we show that, complementarity effects depend on tree size along an energy availability gradient across Europe. Specifically: (i) complementarity effects at low and intermediate positions of the gradient (coldest-temperate areas) were stronger for small than for large trees; (ii) in contrast, at the upper end of the gradient (warmer regions), complementarity is more widespread in larger than smaller trees, which in turn showed negative growth responses to increased functional dissimilarity. Our findings suggest that the outcome of species mixing on stand productivity might critically depend on individual size distribution structure along gradients of environmental variation.},

Designed experiments are expensive to implement and maintain for a sufficiently long time in most temperate species, but associated treatment replication and randomization lower the risk of confounding from spatial correlations among species composition, environmental conditions, and productivity. Results from replicated mixed-species spacing trials in 45-yr-old Pinus ponderosa/Abies grandis plots and 53-yr-old P. ponderosa/P. contorta plots demonstrated main and interaction effects of spacing and species composition on growth and stand structure, as well as the change in these effects over time. Initial spacing ranged from 1.8 m to 5.5 m on a square grid. Mixtures of P. ponderosa and A. grandis at wide spacings offered A. grandis the opportunity to achieve cumulative height growth nearly equal to P. ponderosa and thereby form a uniform mixed canopy but lower cumulative stem volume growth. The same initial species mixture at closer spacing resulted in increasingly stratified mixtures with P. ponderosa dominating the overstory due largely to its more rapid juvenile height growth and wider crown, relegating shade tolerant A. grandis to the understory. A similar pattern emerged in the mixtures of P. ponderosa and P. contorta, but with more subtle gradients in vertical structure attributable to less extreme differences in juvenile height growth and shade tolerance. By the end of 2019 (plantation age 53), no significant overyielding or underyielding occurred in the mixed-species plots of P. ponderosa/P. contorta. In contrast, by the end of 2018 the mixed-species plots of P. ponderosa/A. grandis (plantation age 45 years) achieved some overyielding that was marginally significant (net volume production) or very significant (gross volume production) only at the narrowest (1.8-m) spacing. The timing and intensity of mortality shifted mixing effects on periodic annual increment slightly over time. Evidence for consistent overyielding among spacings was weak in these P. ponderosa/P. contorta and P. ponderosa/A. grandis spacing trials at total plantation age of 53 and 45 years, respectively. However, statistical power for detecting mixing effects was limited by the relatively small number of replications, and size differentiation continues to emerge at successively wider spacings on mixed-species plots.},

Many forests in the western United States are being treated to reduce fuels, yet the effects of these treatments on forest carbon are not well understood. We compared the immediate effects of fuels treatments on carbon stocks and releases in replicated plots before and after treatment, and against a reconstruction of active-fire stand conditions for the same forest in 1865. Total live-tree carbon was substantially lower in modern fire-suppressed conditions (and all of the treatments) than the same forest under an active-fire regime. Although fire suppression has increased stem density, current forests have fewer very large trees, reducing total live-tree carbon stocks and shifting a higher proportion of those stocks into small-diameter, firesensitive trees. Prescribed burning released 14.8 Mg C/ha, with pre-burn thinning increasing the average release by 70\% and contributing 21.9-37.5 Mg C/ha in milling waste. Fire suppression may have incurred a double carbon penalty by reducing stocks and contributing to emissions with fuels-treatment activities or inevitable wildfire combustion. All treatments reduced fuels and increased fire resistance, but most of the gains were achieved with understory thinning, with only modest increases in the much heavier overstory thinning. We suggest modifying current treatments to focus on reducing surface fuels, actively thinning the majority of small trees, and removing only fire-sensitive species in the merchantable, intermediate size class. These changes would retain most of the current carbon-pool levels, reduce prescribed burn and potential future wildfire emissions, and favor stand development of large, fire-resistant trees that can better stabilize carbon stocks. \textcopyright{} 2009 by the Ecological Society ot America.},

There has been a slight decline in burning over the past 3,000 y, with the lowest levels attained during the 20th century and during the Little Ice Age (LIA, ca. 1400-1700 CE [Common Era]). Prominent peaks in forest fires occurred during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (ca. 950-1250 CE) and during the 1800s. Analysis of climate reconstructions beginning from 500 CE and population data show that temperature and drought predict changes in biomass burning up to the late 1800s CE. Since the late 1800s , human activities and the ecological effects of recent high fire activity caused a large, abrupt decline in burning similar to the LIA fire decline. Consequently, there is now a forest "fire deficit" in the western United States attributable to the combined effects of human activities, ecological, and climate changes. Large fires in the late 20th and 21st century fires have begun to address the fire deficit, but it is continuing to grow.},

Abstract: Competition is a key factor driving forest dynamics and stand structure during the course of stand development. Although the role of neighbourhood competition on stand dynamics has received increasing attention, the response of competition to environmental fluctuations and stand development remains poorly explored. We evaluated changes in competition during stand development in a dry-edge Scots pine relict population located in Central Spain. Typically, tree-to-tree interactions have been investigated through static competition measurements, which usually lack the temporal variation associated to natural forest development and environmental conditions. Here, we assessed how individual and neighbourhood components of competition evolved along a 35-year period, and we related competition dynamics to population structure and drought levels. On six plots, 508 trees were mapped and diameters at breast height (DBH) were measured. Two increment cores were taken from target trees to derive basal area increment (BAI), and neighbourhood was reconstructed back to 1980. Results provide insights into inter-annual variability in competition effects and their role on tree radial growth depending on climatic conditions. From the year 2005 onwards, both individual and neighbourhood components of competition showed a decoupled pattern over time. This effect was particularly pronounced during the extreme drought in 2012, in which the individual component decreased, whereas the neighbourhood component increased. In addition, climatic variability modulated the competition effects during stand development. This approach of evaluating competition dynamics proves to be promising for studying forest stand development and the influence of climate impacts on tree populations subjected to xeric conditions.},

  abstract = {The pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) is of special interest to wildlife managers; it requires large trees for nesting, and its abandoned excavations are used by many birds and other small animals for nesting, roosting, hiding, and feeding. Prior to our study, little had been published on pileated woodpecker habitat in the northern Rocky Mountains. From 1973 through 1995, we located nest and roost trees of pileated woodpeckers in northwestern Montana forests dominated by western larch (Larix occidentalis) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Nests (133 in 97 trees) were in western larch (n=52), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa, n=18), black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa, n=15), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides, n=7), western white pine (Pinus monticola, n=3), grand fir (Abies grandis, n=1), and Douglas-fir (n=1). Nest-tree diameter-at-breast-height averaged 73 cm, and height averaged 29 m. Roost trees (n=40) were similar to nest trees, but had more cavity entrances and higher basal area of surrounding forest. Nest trees and roost trees typically were snags (81\% and 78\%, respectively) with broken tops (77\% in both). Old-growth stands containing western larch were common nesting sites for pileated woodpeckers. Old-growth ponderosa pine, black cottonwood, and trembling aspen were locally important, but their distribution was more restricted. Compared to other nest-tree species in Montana, undecayed larch wood is hard, making excavation difficult for woodpeckers. Heartwood decay, which softens the wood, becomes more prevalent as a forest matures and was characteristic of western larch nest trees. In the northern Rocky Mountains, the pileated woodpecker has been used too broadly and simplistically as a management indicator of old growth. A more realistic strategy would nurture western larch old growth, defined ecologically, as an indicator of high-quality nesting habitat for pileated woodpeckers; Large trees, logs, snags, carpenter ants (Camponotus spp.), and heartwood decay are intrinsic components of "healthy" old growth that sustains pileated woodpeckers.},

  abstract = {Wildfire area is predicted to increase with global warming. Empirical statistical models and process-based simulations agree almost universally. The key relationship for this unanimity, observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales, is between drought and fire. Predictive models often focus on ecosystems in which this relationship appears to be particularly strong, such as mesic and arid forests and shrublands with substantial biomass such as chaparral. We examine the drought-fire relationship, specifically the correlations between water-balance deficit and annual area burned, across the full gradient of deficit in the western USA, from temperate rainforest to desert. In the middle of this gradient, conditional on vegetation (fuels), correlations are strong, but outside this range the equivalence hotter and drier equals more fire either breaks down or is contingent on other factors such as previous-year climate. This suggests that the regional drought-fire dynamic will not be stationary in future climate, nor will other more complex contingencies associated with the variation in fire extent. Predictions of future wildfire area therefore need to consider not only vegetation changes, as some dynamic vegetation models now do, but also potential changes in the drought-fire dynamic that will ensue in a warming climate.},

  abstract = {Fire is a powerful ecological and evolutionary force that regulates organismal traits, population sizes, species interactions, community composition, carbon and nutrient cycling and ecosystem function. It also presents a rapidly growing societal challenge, due to both increasingly destructive wildfires and fire exclusion in fire-dependent ecosystems. As an ecological process, fire integrates complex feedbacks among biological, social and geophysical processes, requiring coordination across several fields and scales of study. Here, we describe the diversity of ways in which fire operates as a fundamental ecological and evolutionary process on Earth. We explore research priorities in six categories of fire ecology: (a) characteristics of fire regimes, (b) changing fire regimes, (c) fire effects on above-ground ecology, (d) fire effects on below-ground ecology, (e) fire behaviour and (f) fire ecology modelling. We identify three emergent themes: the need to study fire across temporal scales, to assess the mechanisms underlying a variety of ecological feedbacks involving fire and to improve representation of fire in a range of modelling contexts. Synthesis: As fire regimes and our relationships with fire continue to change, prioritizing these research areas will facilitate understanding of the ecological causes and consequences of future fires and rethinking fire management alternatives.},

In the South Island of New Zealand, Polynesians (M\=aori), who arrived 700-800 calibrated years (cal y) ago, and then Europeans, who settled {$\sim$}150 cal y ago, used fire as a tool for forest clearance, but the structure and environmental consequences of these fires are poorly understood. High-resolution charcoal and pollen records from 16 lakes were analyzed to reconstruct the fire and vegetation history of the last 1,000 y. Diatom, chironomid, and element concentration data were examined to identify disturbance-related limnobiotic and biogeochemical changes within burned watersheds. At most sites, several highseverity fire events occurred within the first two centuries of M\=aori arrival and were often accompanied by a transformation in vegetation, slope stability, and lake chemistry. Proxies of past climate suggest that human activity alone, rather than unusually dry or warm conditions, was responsible for this increased fire activity. The transformation of scrub to grassland by Europeans in the mid-19th century triggered further, sometimes severe, watershed change, through additional fires, erosion, and the introduction of nonnative plant species. Alteration of natural disturbance regimes had lasting impacts, primarily because native forests had little or no previous history of fire and little resilience to the severity of burning. Anthropogenic burning in New Zealand highlights the vulnerability of closed-canopy forests to novel disturbance regimes and suggests that similar settings may be less resilient to climateinduced changes in the future.},

We also compare the simulations of these models under doubled CO2 and a range of climate scenarios. For contemporary conditions, the biogeography models successfully simulate the geographic distribution of major vegetation types and have similar estimates of area for forests (42 to 46\% of the conterminous United States), grasslands (17 to 27\%), savannas (15 to 25\%), and shrublands (14 to 18\%). The biogeochemistry models estimate similar continental-scale net primary production (NPP; 3125 to 3772 \texttimes{} 1012 gC yr-1) and total carbon storage (108 to 118 \texttimes{} 1015 gC) for contemporary conditions. Among the scenarios of doubled CO2 and associated equilibrium climates produced by the three general circulation models (Oregon State University (OSU), Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), and United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO)), all three biogeography models show both gains and losses of total forest area depending on the scenario (between 38 and 53\% of conterminous United States area). The only consistent gains in forest area with all three models (BIOME2, DOLY, and MAPSS) were under the GFDL scenario due to large increases in precipitation. MAPSS lost forest area under UKMO, DOLY under OSU, and BIOME2 under both UKMO and OSU. The variability in forest area estimates occurs because the hydrologic cycles of the biogeography models have different sensitivities to increases in temperature and CO2. However, in general, the biogeography models produced broadly similar results when incorporating both climate change and elevated CO2 concentrations. For these scenarios, the NPP estimated by the biogeochemistry models increases between 2\% (BIOME-BGC with UKMO climate) and 35\% (TEM with UKMO climate). Changes in total carbon storage range from losses of 33\% (BIOME-BGC with UKMO climate) to gains of 16\% (TEM with OSU climate). The CENTURY responses of NPP and carbon storage are positive and intermediate to the responses of BIOME-BGC and TEM. The variability in carbon cycle responses occurs because the hydrologic and nitrogen cycles of the biogeochemistry models have different sensitivities to increases in temperature and CO2. When the biogeochemistry models are run with the vegetation distributions of the biogeography models, NPP ranges from no response (BIOME-BGC with all three biogeography model vegetations for UKMO climate) to increases of 40\% (TEM with MAPSS vegetation for OSU climate). The total carbon storage response ranges from a decrease of 39\% (BIOME-BGC with MAPSS vegetation for UKMO climate) to an increase of 32\% (TEM with MAPSS vegetation for OSU and GFDL climates). The UKMO responses of BIOME-BGC with MAPSS vegetation are primarily caused by decreases in forested area and temperature-induced water stress. The OSU and GFDL responses of TEM with MAPSS vegetations are primarily caused by forest expansion and temperature-enhanced nitrogen cycling. Copyright 1995 by the American Geophysical Union.}

However, despite the increased number of studies on biodiversity\textendash ecosystem function, we still lack information on how stratification in tropical forests modulates biodiversity effects. Moreover, there is less investigation and argument on the role of species and functional traits in forest layers. Here, we analysed from a perspective of forest layer (sub-canopy, canopy and emergent species layers), the relationship between diversity and aboveground biomass (AGB), focusing on functional diversity and dominance, and underlying mechanisms such as niche complementarity and selection. The sub-canopy layer had the highest species richness and diversity, while the emergent layer had the highest AGB. Species richness\textendash AGB relationship was positive for each forest layer, but stronger for sub-canopy layer than for canopy and emergent layers. Total AGB was strongly correlated with functional diversity, leaf and wood traits of species in the sub-canopy and canopy layers. This suggests that sub-canopy and canopy species are major drivers of stand diversity\textendash AGB relationship, and that resource filtering by canopy or emergent trees may not reduce the strength of diversity\textendash AGB relationship in the sub-canopy layer. We argue that complementary resource use by sub-canopy species that supports niche complementarity, is a key mechanism driving AGB in natural forests. Selection effects are most evident in emergent species and niche complementarity effects for sub-canopy and canopy species, supporting arguments that AGB is affected by sub-canopy species' efficient use of limited resources despite competition from emergent species.},

To quantify the impact on E and GPP, we have made eddy-covariance (EC) measurements of water vapor and carbon dioxide fluxes for nine years above a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) stand in northern interior BC that was not salvage harvested following beetle attack in 2006. To understand the processes and determine long-term recovery of the water and carbon balances of this stand following attack, we modified the 3-PG (Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth) model to include the effects of insect attack on the stand, and modelled monthly E, GPP and water use efficiency (WUE) of the understory and overstory. The modified model was validated using the flux and climate measurements made during the nine-year period. It generally worked well with modelled annual E and GPP agreeing reasonably well with their measured values. Modelled values of annual E and GPP decreased by about 62\% and 52\%, respectively, between 2005 and 2007. Annual measured E remained remarkably stable for five years after the attack, and then increased by {$\sim$}13\% year-1 in the last four years; however, the model indicated a relatively steady increase of {$\sim$}13\% year-1 over the 9 years. On the other hand, EC-estimated GPP showed a steady recovery ({$\sim$}9\% year-1) almost returning to estimated pre-attack levels within nine years. Modelled annual GPP generally agreed with EC-estimated values as well as capturing much of the interannual variability observed in the last 4 years. Projections for the following decade, depending on expected climate change, suggested that E would slightly increase, GPP would remain relatively constant, and WUE would decrease slightly. With the decrease in E, modelled drainage (Dr) increased significantly in the first year after attack compared to pre-attack estimates, but gradually decreased again in the following years. Measured and modelled Dr decreased between 2007 and 2015 by about 28\% and 49\%, respectively. Projections show Dr staying relatively constant for the following decade (2016\textendash 2025). Our observations that the recovery of E and GPP was faster than expected suggest that not to salvage harvest MPB-attacked stands with considerable remaining live canopy trees or understory should be a beneficial management strategy from carbon sequestration and hydrologic perspectives.},

The Barrens on the south coast of Western Australia and the Caledon coast in South Africa receive only light falls of winter frontal rain, resulting in very similar mediterranean climates. Vegetation consisting of tall shrubs consequently occurs in both of these areas although formed of different floras. Elsewhere under a mediterranean and associated arid climate, tall trees grow in Australia where, on similar soils, only shrubs or low trees grow in southern Africa. However, it is now realized that these parts of Australia are exposed to rain-storms made more intense by the warmth of the offshore waters west and northwest of the continent. The mediterranean climate on the west coast receives intense winter rain absent from South Africa. In addition, occasional but extremely heavy rains originating off the north-west of Australia during late summer and autumn affect the arid area inland and north of the mediterranean climate which would otherwise have only very light winter rainfall and a vegetation of low shrubs. It is suggested that trees are widespread in dry environments in Australia because of unusually effective, deep-wetting rainfall rather than the peculiar flora of the region.}

Managers need to know the consequences of an increase in area burned that might result from an increase in wildland fi re use. One concern of land managers as they consider implementing wildland fi re use is whether they can meet the goals in the land management plan for the desired distribution of forest structural stages across the landscape with further increases in fi re. These questions were explored for a 49,532 ha landscape on the Boise National Forest in Idaho that typically experiences mixed-severity and stand-replacing fi res. The landscape simulation model TELSA was used to evaluate how increases in fi re frequency and area burned might affect landscape composition and structure. Information about frequency, annual area burned, and size-class distributions of fi res derived from a fi re atlas for the northern Rocky Mountains were used to defi ne the fi re regime parameters for fi ve different simulation scenarios. Scenarios with higher fi re frequency and area burned resulted in landscapes dominated by earlier successional forest stages and only small patches occupied by large trees. Simulated variability in area occupied by different tree-size classes on this landscape was much greater than the desired ranges defi ned in the land management plan for the forest at large. A measure of dissimilarity (Euclidean Distance) from desired composition was used to evaluate scenarios for their relative ability to achieve long term land management goals. The lowest values of Euclidean Distance were for a scenario that represents a substantial increase in fi re over 20th century fi re regimes. Euclidean Distance increased for scenarios with very high rates of burning, implying an upper limit to the desired amount of fi re for this landscape. These fi ndings could be used to develop guidance for achieving desired conditions with wildland fi re use.},

An FVS user may choose to have increments in diameter, height, crown ratio, and mortality from STAND-BGC replace those generated by FVS. This option essentially replaces the empirical growth engine of FVS with the physiological engine from STAND-BGC. Physiological and mensurational outputs were generated for an existing, fully stocked, Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. stand, with and without thinning, using the hybrid model. The STAND-BGC engine produced results similar to FVS for the unthinned stand but predicted more rapid tree growth than FVS following thinning. Simulations for a newly regenerated stand using the linked model allowed assessment of the predicted effects of grass competition and drought on stand production. Comparisons of model predictions to remeasured permanent plot data showed the empirical and process growth engines had similar precision, but that STAND-BGC substantially overpredicted growth, while FVS slightly underpredicted growth. The need for model calibration and opportunities for more sophisticated communication between models is discussed.}

Therefore, (2) the horizontal radial growth of any vigorous portion of the crown can be estimated from height growth or a height-age curve, provided that correction for the crooks, curvature oand angle of branches are incorporated into the relationship. (3) The height of a tree is a function of the height (Hd) of dominant trees and the width of its crown (CW) relative to the maximum crown witdth (C\$\textbackslash backslash\$VMAX) it could have attained had it grown without competition from surrounding trees (r squared = .55). (4) Trees have a 50\% chance of being overtopped when the natural log of CW/CWMAX is less than or equal to 1.75 and, based on data from Ontario, usually die if that is less than 1.85. (5) Crown area, defined by the vertical projection of the crown, and tree height provide an accurate estimate of bole diameter (r squared 0.93) and bole volume (r squared .92). A mathematical model was developed which simulates growth of stands in terms of the crown expansions of individual trees. A particular plot from which growth predictions are to be made is represented in the memory unit of the computer by a matrix which contains one entry for each square foot of growing space. Each entry contains a code denoting the number of the tree if the particular location is occupied. The nmber of entries occuupied by each treee increases as teh crowns of inidivulad trees expand into vacant growing space. The spread of the crown, within the limitations imposed by the size and location of competeing trees, is predicated on the expected height-age relationship of dominant trees on the particular site. A random variable is generated by Monte Carlo methods to simulated unexplained sources of variation, e.g. heredity. The resulting asymmetrical development of tree crowns is facilitated by a complex scanning program which directs the computer to search out growing space available to each tree. The height of each tree depends on Hd and CW/CWMAX. Diameter and volume of the bole are estimated from crown area and height. All simulated parameters are derived directly or indirectly from the height growht of dominant trees and the spatial distribution of individual trees. A comparison of the actual and simulated growth of permanent sample plots showed close agreement in terms of bole and crown parameters. The model is designed to replace conventional yield tables and provide a tool for testing silvicultural practices and management plans. It can be applied over large areas with information from low-level aerieal photographs, thus expediting the collection of data.}

Yet, long-term effects have been explored only weakly, especially for forests, and no clear evidence has been found regarding the underlying mechanisms. We explore the long-term relationship between diversity and productivity using a forest succession model. Extensive simulations show that tree species richness promotes productivity in European temperate forests across a large climatic gradient, mostly through strong complementarity between species. We show that this biodiversity effect emerges because increasing species richness promotes higher diversity in shade tolerance and growth ability, which results in forests responding faster to small-scale mortality events. Our study generalises results from short-term experiments in grasslands to forest ecosystems and demonstrates that competition for light alone induces a positive effect of biodiversity on productivity, thus providing a new angle for explaining BEF relationships.},

Natural resource managers in many areas are also challenged by scant locally or regionally relevant information on climate projections and potential impacts. The Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change (ASCC) project was designed to respond to these barriers to operationalizing climate adaptation strategies by providing a multiregion network of replicated operational-scale research sites testing ecosystem-specific climate change adaptation treatments across a gradient of adaptive approaches, and introducing conceptual tools and processes to integrate climate change considerations into management and silvicultural decisionmaking. Here we present the framework of the ASCC project, highlight the implementation process at two of the study sites, and discuss the contributions of this collaborative science-management partnership.},

The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, is a bark beetle that can cause extensive mortality in ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa Lawson, along the Colorado Front Range. Despite the history of outbreaks of this insect in Colorado, no models have been developed to estimate the probability of infestation. Thirty-five clusters of one infested and three baseline plots were established from 1998 to 2000 in the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest in north-central Colorado to develop empirical models of probability of infestation based on forest conditions. Mountain pine beetle-infested plots exhibited higher basal area and stand density index (SDI) for ponderosa pine and for all tree species combined, and higher number of ponderosa pine trees per hectare. Within infested plots, infested trees were larger in diameter at breast height and in the dominant and co-dominant crown positions. A classification tree model indicated that the likelihood of infestation by mountain pine beetle is 0.71 when ponderosa pine basal area is \textbackslash textgreater17.1m2/ha at the stand level. A second plot-level model indicated that the probability of infestation increased with increasing ponderosa pine SDI, ponderosa pine quadratic mean diameter, and total basal area. For individual trees within infested plots the likelihood of infestation was 0.77 for dominant or co-dominant trees \textbackslash textgreater18.2cm in diameter at breast height. Results are consistent with other studies that have documented increased likelihood of infestation or enhanced mortality levels or both as a result of higher host type stocking. The simple models developed should help to guide silvicultural treatments and restoration efforts by establishing stocking levels below which mountain pine beetle-caused mortality is less likely, particularly in the dry sites and poor growing conditions characteristic of the Colorado Front Range.},

We use data from a network of plots established in 2006- 2007 on the Sulphur Ranger District of the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests to develop simple probability of infestation and extent of mortality models using classification and regression trees, respectively. A classification tree indicated that when live lodgepole pine basal area was equal to or greater than 59.3 ft2/acre pre-outbreak, the probability of infestation increased. A second classification tree added lodgepole pine mean diameter as a second splitting variable. The rate of correct classification for both models was greater than 0.79. Two regression trees also used live pre-outbreak lodgepole pine basal area as a splitting variable and indicated increasing basal area killed with increasing live lodgepole pine basal area. These simple models use readily available data from forest inventories and can be used to identify stands, based on forest stand conditions, where mountain pine beetle is more likely to occur and the potential extent of lodgepole pine tree mortality should an outbreak occur.},

This carrying capacity determines the potential carbon sequestration in live trees and the maximum growing stock. Lower stocking through thinning can change growth and mortality. We were interested in the relations between stand structure, increment, and mortality using a long-unmanaged oak-hornbeam forest near Vienna, Austria, as a case study. We expected lower increment for heavily thinned compared to unmanaged stands. We tested the thinning response using three permanent growth plots, in which two were thinned (50\% and 70\% basal area removed) and one remained unmanaged. We calculated stand structure (basal area, stem density, diameter distribution) and increment and mortality of single trees. Over ten years, the heavily thinned stand had a similar increment as that of the moderately thinned and unthinned stands. The basal area of the unthinned stand remained constant and stem density decreased due to competition-related mortality. The studied oak-hornbeam stands responded well even to late and heavy thinning, suggesting a broad ``plateau'' of stocking and increment for these forest types. Lower stem density for thinned stands led to a much larger tree increment of single trees, compared to the unthinned reference. The findings of this study need verification for other soil and climatic conditions.},

Two new methods of assigning fuel models within the Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator were evaluated. Field-based values for dead and downed fuel loading were used to create custom fuel models or to assign stylized fuel models. Fire was simulated with two wind scenarios (maximum 1-minute speed and maximum momentary gust speed) to assess the effect of the fuel model method on potential fire behavior. Surface flame lengths and fire type produced from custom fuel models followed the fluctuations and variability of fine fuel loading more closely than stylized fuel models. However, results of 7 out of 10 statistical tests comparing surface flame length between custom and stylized fuel models were not significant (P \textbackslash textless 0.05), suggesting that both methods used to assign surface fuel loads will predict fairly similar trends in fire behavior. copy; 2014 Society of American Foresters.},

The effects of intermittent drought on tropical tree communities remain poorly understood and the potential impacts of intensified drought under future climatic conditions are even less well known. The response of forests to altered precipitation will be determined by the tolerances of different species to reduced water availability and the interactions among plants that alleviate or exacerbate the effects of drought. Here, we report the response of experimental monocultures and mixtures of tropical trees to simulated drought, which reveals a fundamental shift in the nature of interactions among species. Weaker competition for water in diverse communities allowed seedlings to maintain growth under drought while more intense competition among conspecifics inhibited growth under the same conditions. These results show that reduced competition for water among species in mixtures mediates community resistance to drought. The delayed onset of competition for water among species in more diverse neighbourhoods during drought has potential implications for the coexistence of species in tropical forests and the resilience of these systems to climate change.},

Key variables include mixed-species stratification patterns, live-crown ratio, variability in heights of crop trees, and number of trees/ac. These variables were organized in a decision key to provide a logical and efficient system to assist land managers in making precommercial thinning decisions.

  abstract = {Climate change research has shown irrefutably that global temperatures are rising, and almost all climate-model projections agree that in the coming decades the western US is likely to experience warmer springs and summers. Hotter and drier conditions are a concern for the future of western forests because climate is an important factor in determining plant distributions. The general effects of climate change on forests include a significant increase to the variability in disturbance regimes, shifts in species ranges, or a shift in germination and establishment requirements. Adding to the complexity of challenges faced by western forests are the poor land management practices of the 20th century, such as fire suppression and high- grade logging, which have led to an adverse change in forest structure including a decline in shade intolerant species such as western larch (Larix occidentalis). We modeled the growth and yield effects of climate change on western larch stands in two United States Forest Service (USFS) national forests in Idaho. The Idaho Panhandle National Forests (IPNF) in the North contain core western larch habitat, and the Boise National Forest (BNF) in West Central Idaho represent the southernmost edge of its range. By modeling silvicultural actions, we provide resistance and resilience climate change adaptation strategies for sustaining western larch in the BNF and IPNF. Our results showed that by increasing growing space and available light, nutrients, water and managing horizontal and vertical structure we can improve forest resistance and resilience. Without active management western larch growth, vigor, and abundance will likely decline in the BNF and IPNF as the climate continues to change}

  abstract = {Theory suggests that natural fire regimes can result in landscapes that are both self-regulating and resilient to fire. For example, because fires consume fuel, they may create barriers to the spread of future fires, thereby regulating fire size. Top-down controls such as weather, however, can weaken this effect. While empirical examples demonstrating this pattern-process feedback between vegetation and fire exist, they have been geographically limited or did not consider the influence of time between fires and weather. The availability of remotely sensed data identifying fire activity over the last four decades provides an opportunity to explicitly quantify the ability of wildland fire to limit the progression of subsequent fire. Furthermore, advances in fire progression mapping now allow an evaluation of how daily weather as a top-down control modifies this effect. In this study, we evaluated the ability of wildland fire to create barriers that limit the spread of subsequent fire along a gradient representing time between fires in four large study areas in the western United States. Using fire progression maps in conjunction with weather station data, we also evaluated the influence of daily weather. Results indicate that wildland fire does limit subsequent fire spread in all four study areas, but this effect decays over time; wildland fire no longer limits subsequent fire spread 6-18 years after fire, depending on the study area. We also found that the ability of fire to regulate subsequent fire progression was substantially reduced under extreme conditions compared to moderate weather conditions in all four study areas. This study increases understanding of the spatial feedbacks that can lead to self-regulating landscapes as well as the effects of top-down controls, such as weather, on these feedbacks. Our results will be useful to managers who seek to restore natural fire regimes or to exploit recent burns when managing fire.},

  abstract = {Aim: It has been suggested that on a global scale, fire activity changes along the productivity/aridity gradient following a humped relationship, i.e. the intermediate fire-productivity hypothesis. This relation should be driven by differing relative roles of the main fire drivers (weather and fuel) along the productivity gradient. However, the full intermediate fire-productivity model across all world ecosystems remains to be validated. Location: The entire globe, excluding Antarctica. Methods: To test the intermediate fire-productivity hypothesis, we use the world ecoregions as a spatial unit and, for each ecoregion, we compiled remotely sensed fire activity, climate, biomass and productivity information. The regression coefficient between monthly MODIS fire activity and monthly maximum temperature in each ecoregion was considered an indicator of the sensitivity of fire to high temperatures in the ecoregion. We used linear and generalized additive models to test for the linear and humped relationships. Results: Fire occurs in most ecoregions. Fire activity peaked in tropical grasslands and savannas, and significantly decreased towards the extremes of the productivity gradient. Both the sensitivity of fire to high temperatures and above-ground biomass increased monotonically with productivity. In other words, fire activity in low-productivity ecosystems is not driven by warm periods and is limited by low biomass; in contrast, in high-productivity ecosystems fire is more sensitive to high temperatures, and in these ecosystems, the available biomass for fires is high. Main conclusion: The results support the intermediate fire-productivity model on a global scale and suggest that climatic warming may affect fire activity differently depending on the productivity of the region. Fire regimes in productive regions are vulnerable to warming (drought-driven fire regime changes), while in low-productivity regions fire activity is more vulnerable to fuel changes (fuel-driven fire regime changes). \textcopyright{} 2012 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

  abstract = {A new simulator for the spread of forest root diseases, and the testing of it, is presented. It differs from earlier models in that it represents a first step to incorporate the basic processes of spread by individual root contact. It therefore has a generality that allows its use in different host-pathogen and geographic situations. It stochastically grows individual roots longitudinally outward from the stem. They are tapered, turn, and contact other roots as they grow. The simulator transfers fungus stochastically at points of contact between healthy roots and infected stump or tree roots and moves the fungus along infected tree roots stochastically. The fungus can girdle the rootcollar, move out into other roots, and eventually kill the tree. Growth of roots and fungus movement along infected roots is on an annual basis for up to 200 years. Root growth, fungus growth along roots, disease spread, and stand openings are displayed dynamically in color on the computer screen as the simulation proceeds. Estimates for numbers of infected trees and mortality are provided in tabular and graphical form. Results from the simulator were close to the field data it was tested against. \textcopyright{} 2005 Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada.},

The dynamic phenomenon of mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, infestation outbreaks is an inherent spatial and temporal complex process. Agent-based modeling (ABM) facilitates simulating spatial interactions that describe the ecological context in which insect populations spread. The main objective of this study was to develop a model of the MPB forest infestation dynamics. This spatially explicit model integrates geographic information systems (GISs) and ABM to simulate MPB outbreaks at the tree and landscape scales, providing spatiotemporal information of annual distribution and patterns of MPB outbreaks. This prototype was implemented with geographic data generated from aerial overview surveys carried out by the B.C. Ministry of Forests and Range, for the study site in Kamloops, Canada. Results show the direct influence that vigorous forest stands and trees have on higher breeding rates, and therefore in the MPB population increment at a tree scale, in a period of 5 years. The simulation results at the landscape level help to determine the most probable locations of future MPB infestations in a time frame of 10 years. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Logistic regression models were calibrated from reconstructed pre-epidemic stand conditions and post-epidemic mortality levels resulting from a widespread mountain pine beetle outbreak that occurred from 1909 to 1940. Basal area (m2/ha) and stand density index (SDI) were stand-level variables that completely differentiated stands into attacked or non-attacked categories. Whitebark pine stands with basal areas above 10 m2/ha (44 ft2/acre) or with an SDI above 80 had a 100\% probability of being attacked. Tree diameter, basal area per 0.04 ha, trees per 0.04 ha, and number of stems in a tree cluster were significant predictors of individual tree attack (p {$\leq$} 0.001) in logistic regression. The tree-level model may be used to estimate anticipated cumulative mortality in currently or potentially infested whitebark pine stands. Stand susceptibility to mountain pine beetle infestation may be identified from density (basal area) or relative density (SDI) thresholds. Predictor variables selected by the models corroborate the susceptible host characteristics identified in other mountain pine beetle-pine systems. This work presents evidence of the generality of host susceptibility characteristics across pine species and over elevation gradients. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

We conducted a systematic comparison of all forest landscape models currently applied in temperate European forests (LandClim, TreeMig, LANDIS-II, iLand). We examined the uncertainty of model projections under several future climate, disturbance, and dispersal scenarios, and quantified uncertainties by variance partitioning. While projections under past climate conditions were in good agreement with observations, uncertainty under future climate conditions was high, with between-model biomass differences of up to 200 t ha-1. Disturbances strongly influenced landscape dynamics and contributed substantially to uncertainty in model projections ({$\sim$}25\textendash 40\% of observed variance). Overall, model differences were the main source of uncertainty, explaining at least 50\% of observed variance. We advocate a more rigorous and systematic model evaluation and calibration, and a broader use of ensemble projections to quantify uncertainties in future landscape dynamics.},

Exact lethal level depended upon the age of the tissue, but there was a general plateau between the ages 6 and 13 months for sugar pine and Douglas-fir and 3 and 13 months for incense-cedar. Whole plant relative turgidity (RT) lethal points were set for the pines and firs using 13-month-old needles. Dry-weight loss upon soaking the needles was found to increase with the severity of the drought, especially for the firs. Soil moisture content (SMC) lethal points were established for all five species on builders' sand (death began at an SMC probably equivalent to tension above 24 atm) and on pumice soil (death points equivalent to tensions from 15 to 19 atm). Foliage moisture content declined with decreasing soil moisture stress in a straight-line relationship; FMC may be used as an index of soil moisture stress within a rather narrow range of SMC and may also be calibrated with leaf tissue diffusion pressure deficits developing under soil moisture stress to give an index of the water balance of the plant. Based on the SMC at the death point and also upon some species' ability to outlive others under competitive conditions, ponderosa pine, incense-cedar, and Douglas-fir were the most drought resistant, sugar pine the least, and grand fir intermediate. Ways are suggested in which the mixed conifer forests could become established and retain their mixed composition through maturity. The findings suggest that if planting is used to regenerate clearcuts, ponderosa pine and incense-cedar would be first choice, but that sugar pine would also be a preferred species if seeding is used.}

The hypothesis may be tested by examining the trees in narrow transects and recording their numbers in alternating runs of healthy and diseased trees. From the observed distributions of the run lengths the proportion of diseased within-patch trees may be estimated; also the proportion of the stand area occupied by patches. If the total number of diseased trees increases with time, the changes in these two proportions indicate disease spread. It is possible to determine whether there has been an increase in the proportion of diseased trees within the patches; also whether the patches have expanded. Data from two plantations of Pseudotsuga menziesii infected with Armillaria root rot, used as examples, were examined at the beginning and end of a 3-year interval. For these plantations both proportions had probably increased; and also, as the patches spread they coalesced, so that the numerous small patches originally present had combined to form comparatively few, large patches.}

A comparative analysis among all alternative implementations demonstrated that error arose from structural weaknesses in the underlying model. Furthermore, the way the model is currently implemented in the Forest Vegetation Simulator partly masks poor performance at the tree level, but likely amplifies error at the stand level, a particularly troubling result in many conceivable applications. Our results also affirm that a simple adjustment factor as a function of dbh provides an inadequate correction of prediction bias.

Karst.) and ten European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) thinning experiments in Germany, for which both residual and removed stock had been registered first during 1870, I scrutinize how moderate and heavy thinning from below (B-, C-grade) affects the production of merchantable volume compared with light thinning (A-grade). In relation to A-grade, cumulative merchantable volume (CV) of B- and C-grade amounts in average to 103-107\% in juvenile and to 97-102\% in mature Norway spruce stands. The corresponding findings for European beech are 101-106\% and 94-102\%. CV of individual stands varies between 89\% and 130\% for Norway spruce and 73\% and 155\% for European beech (CV of A-grade = 100\%). These findings are substantiated by the relation between stand density (SDI) and periodic annual increment (PAI). On the B- and C-grade plots of spruce and beech, respectively, SDI was reduced down to 41-91\% and 31-83\% of the A-grade. When SDI is reduced in young stands, PAI follows a unimodal curve. Norway spruce's PAI culminates in 109\% if SDI is reduced to 59\%; European beech's PAI culminates in 123\% when density is reduced to 50\%. Whereas Norway spruce's growth reacts most positively on thinning under poor site conditions and with increment reduction on favourable sites, European beech behaves oppositely. With stand development the culmination point of the unimodal relation moves towards maximum density, so that in older stands PAI follows the increasing pattern, which is the left portion of a unimodal curve. A model is presented which apparently unifies contradictory patterns of stand density-growth reactions by integrating relative stand density, average tree size and site fertility effects, and makes the findings operable for forest management. \textcopyright{} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

In order to reveal the effect of mixture we established 37 experimental plots in even-aged pure and mixed stands of Norway spruce and European beech covering an age span of 37-155 years. The site conditions ranged from warm, dry and base-rich to cool, wet and acidic sites. The ratio of above ground biomass growth of Norway spruce in relation to European beech decreases from 1.14:1 in the monocultures to 1.04:1 in the mixed stands. The mixing of spruce and beech results in a mutual stimulation of biomass production and acceleration of size growth. Together both species produce up to 59\% more above ground biomass than the neighboring pure stands. On average the overyielding amounts to 21\% in the case of Norway spruce and 37\% in the case of European beech. A total of 67\% out of the plots indicate overyielding and 57\% transgressive overyielding. In mixed stands both species] tree sizes are significantly ahead of the corresponding pure stands. Facilitation of spruce and competitive reduction of beech yields mutualism with respect to growth on tree and stand level. Consequences for analyzing and modeling interspecific competition and for silvicultural prescriptions are discussed. Ecological implications of the mixing effect on the occurrence and stability of natural and man-made mixed stands of spruce and beech are considered. \textcopyright{} pringer-Verlag 2008.},

On poor sites, where significant overyielding is commonly found, facilitation by beech offsets nutrient-related growth limitations in spruce. In contrast, overyielding of mixed stands occurs less frequently on rich sites, and appears to be based on an admixture effect, with spruce reducing the severe intra-specific competition common in pure beech stands. \textbullet{} It was concluded that silviculture can accelerate growth of spruce by beech admixtures on poor sites, while growth of beech can be promoted by admixture of spruce, particularly on excellent sites. \textcopyright{} INRA, EDP Sciences, 2010.},

  abstract = {Mixing of complementary tree species may increase stand productivity, mitigate the effects of drought and other risks, and pave the way to forest production systems which may be more resource-use efficient and stable in the face of climate change. However, systematic empirical studies on mixing effects are still missing for many commercially important and widespread species combinations. Here we studied the growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in mixed versus pure stands on 32 triplets located along a productivity gradient through Europe, reaching from Sweden to Bulgaria and from Spain to the Ukraine. Stand inventory and taking increment cores on the mainly 60\textendash 80 year-old trees and 0.02\textendash 1.55 ha sized, fully stocked plots provided insight how species mixing modifies the structure, dynamics and productivity compared with neighbouring pure stands. In mixture standing volume (+12 \%), stand density (+20 \%), basal area growth (+12 \%), and stand volume growth (+8 \%) were higher than the weighted mean of the neighbouring pure stands. Scots pine and European beech contributed rather equally to the overyielding and overdensity. In mixed stands mean diameter (+20 \%) and height (+6 \%) of Scots pine was ahead, while both diameter and height growth of European beech were behind (-8 \%). The overyielding and overdensity were independent of the site index, the stand growth and yield, and climatic variables despite the wide variation in precipitation (520\textendash 1175 mm year-1), mean annual temperature (6\textendash 10.5 \textdegree C), and the drought index by de Martonne (28\textendash 61 mm \textdegree C-1) on the sites. Therefore, this species combination is potentially useful for increasing productivity across a wide range of site and climatic conditions. Given the significant overyielding of stand basal area growth but the absence of any relationship with site index and climatic variables, we hypothesize that the overyielding and overdensity results from several different types of interactions (light-, water-, and nutrient-related) that are all important in different circumstances. We discuss the relevance of the results for ecological theory and for the ongoing silvicultural transition from pure to mixed stands and their adaptation to climate change.},

Recent papers show that mixed stands can have higher yields, but it remains open whether mixed stands simply grow faster along the same self-thinning lines as pure stands or have higher maximum stand densities. We analyzed the effect of species mixing on maximum density based on triplets of pure and mixed stands at approximately maximum density. Most considered mixtures include Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.). We show that (i) in mixed stands, maximum density is, on average, 16.5\% higher than in neighbouring pure stands, and (ii) species mixtures with Norway spruce exceed densities of pure stands by 8.8\%, on average. For individual species mixtures, we find a significant density effect of +29.1\% for Norway spruce mixed with European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) and +35.9\% for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in association with European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). No significant links with stand variables such as age and mean tree size and site fertility were found. The results indicate that species mixing substantially increases stand density, indicating a higher carrying capacity caused by a higher supply and use efficiency of resources. The implications for inventory, silviculture, and forest modelling are discussed.},

  abstract = {A better understanding and a more quantitative design of mixed-species stands will contribute to more integrative and goal-oriented research in mixed-species forests. Much recent work has indicated that the structure and growth of mixed species forests may fundamentally differ from monocultures. Here we suggest how to progress from the present accumulation of phenomenological findings to a design of mixed-species stands and advanced silvicultural prescriptions by means of modelling. First, the knowledge of mixing effects on the structure and growth at the stand, species, and individual tree level is reviewed, with a focus on those findings that are most essential for suitable modelling and silvicultural designs and the regulation of mixed stands as opposed to monocultures. Then, the key role of growth models, stand simulators, and scenario assessments for designing mixed species stands is discussed. The next section illustrates that existing forest stand growth models require some fundamental modifications to become suitable for both monocultures and mixed-species stands. We then explore how silvicultural prescriptions derived from scenario runs would need to be both quantified and simplified for transfer to forest management and demonstrated in training plots. Finally, we address the main remaining knowledge gaps that could be remedied through empirical research.},

How do mixed-species stands compare with monocultures in relation to productivity, wood quality, and ecological stability in the face of stress and disturbances? How are the effects of species mixtures on ecosystem functioning influenced by the particular species composition, site conditions, and stand structure? How does any over- or underyielding at the forest-stand level emerge from the tree and organ level, and what are the main mechanisms behind mixing effects? How can our current scientific understanding of mixed-species forests be integrated into silvicultural concepts as well as practical forest management and planning? Do the ecological characteristics of mixed-species stands also translate into economic differences between mixtures and monocultures? In addition, the book addresses experimental designs and analytical approaches to study mixed-species forests and provides extensive empirical information, general concepts, models, and management approaches for mixed-species forests. As such, it offers a valuable resource for students, scientists and educators, as well as professional forest planners, managers, and consultants.},

  abstract = {Tree species mixtures can overyield monospecific stands and provide many other advantageous regulating and provisioning ecosystem services. So far, the effect of mixing on growth were mostly described at the individual tree level or cumulatively at the stand level. How overyielding emerges from the mixing pattern, how it is modulated by the current environmental conditions, and how overyielding develops with progressing stand age is largely unexplored. However, such knowledge might promote the silvicultural design of mixed stands. Here, we use 50 long-term experimental plots in Germany with repeated spatially explicit stand inventories. They cover monospecific and mixed species stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), sessile oak (Quercus petraea [Matt.] Liebl.) and European beech, and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and European beech. The stands represent medium to very good site conditions, fully to moderately thinned 15\textendash 238 years-old stands with mixing patterns ranging from single-tree and group-mixture to monospecific stands. The main hypothesis is that mixing pattern, environmental conditions, and stand age modulate the stand growth and overyielding of mixed versus monospecific stands. Based on metrics of mixing the mixing pattern and indices of environmental conditions we show that mixed stands of European beech were on averaged by 12\textendash 36\% more productive than respective monocultures. Overyielding can increase with stand density, mixing degree, regularity of horizontal tree distribution, tree size variation, site index, and water supply. Overyielding continued throughout the whole rotation time. The found overyielding suggests general facilitative effects of mixing in terms of bioclimate or soil conditions, independent of the mixing pattern. In addition to this general effect, overyielding was increased by stand density and mixing degree. This suggests a strong competition reduction due to structural complementarity. That the overyielding increases in moist years, points to the competition reduction as dominant cause. We hypothesize that in moist years competition for light and nutrient becomes stronger, so that species complementarity is more important and competition reduction may operate stronger and more beneficial for growth than in years with growth limitation by water. The findings stress the relevance of spatially explicit approaches of analyzing and modelling facilitation and competition at the stand and tree level. Silvicultural prescriptions may incorporate the findings that the analyzed mixtures with European beech in general overyield monospecific stands and that the benefit can be further increased by stand density, mixing degree, and tree size variation. Beneficial effects of mixtures can be expected on medium to high quality sites, in dry years, and even more in moist periods.},

CONSUME and the First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM), predictive models developed to estimate fuel consumption and emissions from wildland fires, have not been systematically evaluated for application in the eastern US using the same validation data set. In this study, we compiled a fuel consumption data set from 54 operational prescribed fires (43 pine and 11 mixed hardwood sites) to assess each model's uncertainties and application limits. Regions of indifference between measured and predicted values by fuel category and forest type represent the potential error that modelers could incur in estimating fuel consumption by category. Overall, FOFEM predictions have narrower regions of indifference than CONSUME and suggest better correspondence between measured and predicted consumption. However, both models offer reliable predictions of live fuel (shrubs and herbaceous vegetation) and 1 h fine fuels. Results suggest that CONSUME and FOFEM can be improved in their predictive capability for woody fuel, litter, and duff consumption for eastern US forests. Because of their high biomass and potential smoke management problems, refining estimates of litter and duff consumption is of particular importance.},

Species within existing communities may respond to climate change individualistically, resulting in the formation of novel communities, or may instead shift as intact communities. We examined whether montane plant communities in the northeastern United States have shifted their elevational range as intact assemblages or individualistically in response to recent regional climatic and environmental change. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to examine changes in plant community composition and species distributions using vegetation surveys repeated five times between 1964 and 2006 across an elevational gradient (549-1 158 m) on Camels Hump Mountain, Vermont, USA, in conjunction with an analysis of local climate change. We found evidence that species elevational distributions and community compositions have shifted in response to a 0.49 \textdegree C per decade warming. These species responses were complex and largely individualistic at some elevations, while at other elevations species in a given community tended to respond similarly. The magnitude of community compositional change was largely dependent on location with respect to the ecotone between northern hardwood and boreal forests. While climate change likely contributed to the large shifts in species within NMDS space, these shifts may also be a response to invasive earthworms at low elevations and to prolonged exposure to acid deposition at high elevations. Though we found evidence of shared species responses within communities, future species responses may become increasingly divergent as the magnitude of climate change increases causing species-specific environmental thresholds to be reached and as the synergistic effects of multiple anthropogenic perturbations rise.},

  abstract = {Background: Measurements of tree heights and diameters are essential in forest assessment and modelling. Tree heights are used for estimating timber volume, site index and other important variables related to forest growth and yield, succession and carbon budget models. However, the diameter at breast height (dbh) can be more accurately obtained and at lower cost, than total tree height. Hence, generalized height-diameter (h-d) models that predict tree height from dbh, age and other covariates are needed. For a more flexible but biologically plausible estimation of covariate effects we use shape constrained generalized additive models as an extension of existing h-d model approaches. We use causal site parameters such as index of aridity to enhance the generality and causality of the models and to enable predictions under projected changeable climatic conditions. Methods: We develop unconstrained generalized additive models (GAM) and shape constrained generalized additive models (SCAM) for investigating the possible effects of tree-specific parameters such as tree age, relative diameter at breast height, and site-specific parameters such as index of aridity and sum of daily mean temperature during vegetation period, on the h-d relationship of forests in Lower Saxony, Germany. Results: Some of the derived effects, e.g. effects of age, index of aridity and sum of daily mean temperature have significantly non-linear pattern. The need for using SCAM results from the fact that some of the model effects show partially implausible patterns especially at the boundaries of data ranges. The derived model predicts monotonically increasing levels of tree height with increasing age and temperature sum and decreasing aridity and social rank of a tree within a stand. The definition of constraints leads only to marginal or minor decline in the model statistics like AIC. An observed structured spatial trend in tree height is modelled via 2-dimensional surface fitting. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the SCAM approach allows optimal regression modelling flexibility similar to the standard GAM but with the additional possibility of defining specific constraints for the model effects. The longitudinal character of the model allows for tree height imputation for the current status of forests but also for future tree height prediction.},

  abstract = {1. To test hypotheses concerning adaptation and acclimation of tree species to shaded habitats we determined the growth, biomass partitioning and morphology of seedlings of nine near-boreal tree species in high- and low-light greenhouse environment (25 and 5\% of full sunlight, respectively), comparable to sunlit gap and shaded microsites in boreal forests. The species differ widely in shade tolerance, seed size and leaf life span. 2. In low light, all species allocated proportionally more biomass to stems and less to roots, but the same to foliage, compared with the high-light environment. At a common size, all species had finer leaf morphology (higher specific leaf area, SLA) but coarser root morphology (lower specific root length, SRL) in low than high light. From a whole plant perspective, all species enhanced leaf area per unit plant mass (leaf area ratio, LAR) in low light and root length per unit plant mass (root length ratio, RLR) in high light. 3. Shade-intolerant deciduous species had higher RGR, SLA and SRL than larger seeded evergreens: ranking from Populus, Betula and Larix spp., then to five evergreen Pinus, Picea and Thuja spp., which were generally comparable in these traits. There were no changes in growth rankings of species between high- and low-light environments, nor consistent differences among species in biomass partitioning. Hence, species differences in leaf and root morphology (SLA, SRL) drove whole plant patterns, such as Populus, Betula and Larix had greater total leaf area and root length per unit plant mass (LAR and RLR, respectively) than the evergreens. Interspecific variation in RGR in both high and low light was positively correlated (r {$\simeq$} 0.9) with SLA, SRL, LAR and RLR, and negatively correlated (r {$\simeq$} -0.9) to seed mass and leaf life span. 4. These data suggest that SLA, SRL, NAR and RGR are closely associated with variation in life-history traits and that variation in leaf and root structure more strongly influences patterns of RGR among species and light environments than does biomass partitioning.},

Of a group of stands of the same average diameter, and, therefore, having the same distribution of diameters, the stand with the greatest number of trees per unit area is obviously the most completely stocked. Age and site quality have no significant effect upon this relationship. For a given species, the maximum number of trees that it is possible for a stand to have is correlated negatively with the average diameter. The curve representing this relationship assumes a straight-line form when plotted on logarithmic paper and is termed the reference curve. In 15 groups of data representing 14 species (13 coniferous), the slope of the number of trees\textemdash average diameter curve was identical for 12 species. The slope for slash pine was slightly greater; that for shortleaf pine was appreciably greater. The heights of these curves, at a given diameter, varied between species. By means of the reference curve ''stand-density index \^\^ is derived for a given stand by plotting its number of trees and diameter, passing a line, parallel to the reference curve, through this point, and reading the number of trees per acre at its intersection with the 10-inch Ordi- nate. This expression may be used for comparisons between species and within a species. Percentage stocking is the percentage expression of the ratio be- tween the number of trees per acre in a given stand and the number, for the same diameter, taken from the maximum curve for the species involved.

  abstract = {Climate changes are expected to increase fire frequency, fire season length, and cumulative area burned in the western United States. We focus on the potential impact of mid-21stcentury climate changes on annual burn probability, fire season length, and large fire characteristics including number and size for a study area in the Northern Rocky Mountains. Although large fires are rare they account for most of the area burned in western North America, burn under extreme weather conditions, and exhibit behaviors that preclude methods of direct control. Allocation of resources, development of management plans, and assessment of fire effects on ecosystems all require an understanding of when and where fires are likely to burn, particularly under altered climate regimes that may increase large fire occurrence. We used the large fire simulation model FSim to model ignition, growth, and containment of wildfires under two climate scenarios: contemporary (based on instrumental weather) and mid-century (based on an ensemble average of global climate models driven by the A1B SRES emissions scenario). Modeled changes in fire patterns include increased annual burn probability, particularly in areas of the study region with relatively short contemporary fire return intervals; increased individual fire size and annual area burned; and fewer years without large fires. High fire danger days, represented by threshold values of Energy Release Component (ERC), are projected to increase in number, especially in spring and fall, lengthening the climatic fire season. For fire managers, ERC is an indicator of fire intensity potential and fire economics, with higher ERC thresholds often associated with larger, more expensive fires. Longer periods of elevated ERC may significantly increase the cost and complexity of fire management activities, requiring new strategies to maintain desired ecological conditions and limit fire risk. Increased fire activity (within the historical range of frequency and severity, and depending on the extent to which ecosystems are adapted) may maintain or restore ecosystem functionality; however, in areas that are highly departed from historical fire regimes or where there is disequilibrium between climate and vegetation, ecosystems may be rapidly and persistently altered by wildfires, especially those that burn under extreme conditions.},

  abstract = {Increased interest in mixed forests is due to evidence of them being more resource-use efficient and stable forest systems. However, intrinsic and extrinsic factors moderate interspecific species interactions generating different effects in productivity. Here, we explore a method to detect mixing effects in a specific mixture combination (Pinus sylvestris L. and Pinus pinaster Ait.), comparing the growth of mixed stands with that of monocultures. Combined tree and stand-level analyses also helped determine which mixing effects are most important for forest functioning and how changes at one level influence patterns at another level. Data from the Spanish National Forest Inventory were used to compare growth efficiency in mixed and pure stands; we relied on relative stand density indices to determine species-specific site occupancy. This same concept was used to evaluate competition status and inter/intra-specific competition effects as modifiers of potential growth at the tree-level. We observed that growth efficiency in both species increased with the proportion of the complementary species in the stand. At the tree-level, intraspecific competition was higher than interspecific competition in Scots pine tree growth, showing that it had benefited from the mixture. In contrast, maritime pine did not show a competitive response to the interspecific interaction, indicating that tree growth was more strongly influenced by the competition structure (size-symmetric and size-asymmetric) than by the species of the competitors. Our results highlight the importance of combining stand-level analysis with that of tree-specific competition relationships when studying mixed-species forests.},

Here, we developed generalized height-diameter (h-d) and basal area growth models for mixed stands of two main forest species in Spain: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.). Mixed-effects models were fitted from plot measurement and tree rings data from 726 Scots pine and 693 Maritime pine trees from mixed and pure stands in the Northern Iberian Range in Spain, with the primary objective of representing interactions between the species where they are interspersed in mixtures of varying proportions. An independent dataset was used to test the performance of the h-d models against models previously fitted for monospecific stands of both species. Basal area increment models were evaluated using a 10-fold block cross-validation procedure. We found that species mixing had contrasting effects on the species in both models. In h-d models, the species-mixing proportion determined the effect of species interactions. Basal area growth models showed that interspecific competition was influential only for Maritime pine; however, these effects differed depending on the mode of competition. For Scots pine, tree growth was not restricted by interspecies competition. The combination of mixed-effect models and the inclusion of parameters expressing species-mixing enhanced estimates of tree height and basal area growth compared with the available models previously developed for pure stands. Although the species-mixing effects were successfully represented in the fitted models, additional model components for accurately simulating the stand dynamics of mixtures with Scots pine and Maritime pine and other species mixtures require similar model refinements. Upon the completion of analyses required for these model refinements, the degree of improvement in simulating growth in species mixtures, including the effects of different management options, can be evaluated.},

  abstract = {After nearly 100 years of fire exclusion, introduced pests, and selective harvesting, a change in forest composition has occurred in many Inland West forests of North America. This change in forest structure has frequently been accompanied by increases in root diseases and/or an unprecedented buildup of fuels. Consequently, many forest managers are implementing plans for fuels treatments to lower the risk of severe wildfires. Impacts on root disease should be considered before selecting appropriate fuels treatments. Complex interactions exist among conifer root diseases, fuels treatments, forest structure, species composition, stand history, and other environmental factors. As forest managers prescribe fuels treatments, their success in lowering the risk of severe wildfire will depend in part on the impacts of these treatments on root disease. Root diseases are one of many factors to be considered when developing plans for fuels treatments. Choices must be made on a site-by-site basis, with knowledge of the diseases that are present. This paper provides examples of how fuels treatments may increase or reduce specific diseases and demonstrates their importance as considerations in the fuels management planning process. Several root diseases prevalent within Inland West of North America are addressed: Armillaria root disease, annosus root disease, laminated root rot, black stain root disease, Schweinitzii root and butt rot, Tomentosus root disease, Rhizina root rot, and stringy butt rot. For each disease, general information is provided on disease identification, management options, and potential effects of fuels treatments. However, many long-term studies are needed to assess effects of specific interactions among fuels treatments, root diseases, and host trees.},

However, such methods have not been widely adopted in forestry, other than the most similar neighbour and nearest neighbor methods. Generalized additive modelling is a flexible semiparametric regression method that is useful when model-based prediction is the main goal and the parametric form of the model is unknown and possibly complex. Routines to fit generalized additive models (GAMs) are now readily available in much statistical software, making them an attractive option for forest modelling. Here, the use of GAMs is demonstrated by the construction of a taper model for six tree species in British Columbia, Canada. We compare the results with an existing flexible parametric taper model. We assess the performance of the models using the 0.632+ bootstrap method according to five key attributes: whole-stem volume, merchantable volume, number of logs, small-end diameter of the first log, and volume of the first log. The results show that the GAMs and the flexible taper function yielded similar accuracy for all attributes and all species.}

  abstract = {While the sediment records of upland lakes are known to be valuable natural archives of depositional changes, recent studies in the UK have shown that full basin records of trace metals are not showing the decline expected as a result of the massive reduction in emissions since the 1970s. As trends in metal deposition across Europe are known to be declining, this `additional' trace metal input to upland lakes can only be the result of mobilisation from catchment storage. We undertook a multiple sediment core, multi-pollutant study at nine lakes across Scotland to test hypotheses that this additional input was a result of (i) a simple time-lag; (ii) catchment soil erosion; (iii) leaching with dissolved organic carbon. We constructed decadally resolved full basin inventories for Pb, Hg and spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs), a particulate component of flyash, at lakes with thin soils, lakes with eroded soils and lakes with non-eroded soils in their catchments to assess temporal trends. The use of both trace metals and SCPs allowed a comparison between erosive (SCPs and metals) and leaching (metals only) processes. Our results showed that the full basin inventories for Hg, Pb and SCPs for lakes with thin catchment soils had similar temporal trends to those of atmospheric emissions and deposition. For lakes with significantly eroded catchment soils, increasing trends in inventories continued to the most recent decades while those with non-eroded soils showed an intermediate pattern with some similarity to atmospheric deposition patterns, but with a reduced recent decline. We conclude that catchment soil erosion is the main transfer mechanism for trace metals at these sites and that although the leaching of metals bound to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) may play a role this appears to be less significant. The processes that lead to soil erosion and leaching of DOC from the catchment are exacerbated by increased winter rainfall, prolonged summer drought and increased frequency of high intensity rain events. Hence, predicted climatic changes will increase pollutant transfer from catchment to surface waters. The catchment storage of deposited pollutants is a massive potential reservoir that could keep fluxes of contaminants to surface waters elevated for many decades to come. This would counteract the benefits of reductions in deposition resulting from policy implementations over recent decades and may elevate exposure of aquatic biota to these contaminants.},

However, the mechanistic basis of this life history trade-off is not well understood. In addition to resource allocation conflicts among multiple traits, functional conflicts arising from individual morphological traits may also contribute to life history trade-offs. We hypothesized that conflicting functional effects of xylem structural traits contribute to the growth-longevity trade-off in trees. We tested this hypothesis by examining the extent to which xylem morphological traits (i.e., wood density, tracheid diameters, and pit structure) relate to growth rates and longevity in two natural populations of the conifer species Pinus ponderosa. Hydraulic constraints arise as trees grow larger and xylem anatomical traits adjust to compensate. We disentangled the effects of size through ontogeny in individual trees and growth rates among trees on xylem traits by sampling each tree at multiple trunk diameters. We found that the oldest trees had slower lifetime growth rates compared with younger trees in the studied populations, indicating a growth-longevity trade-off. We further provide evidence that a single xylem trait, pit structure, with conflicting effects on xylem function (hydraulic safety and efficiency) relates to the growth-longevity trade-off in a conifer species. This study highlights that, in addition to trade-offs among multiple traits, functional constraints based on individual morphological traits like that of pit structure provide mechanistic insight into how and when life history trade-offs arise.},

Although the space between clusters is expected to fill with voluntary regeneration, its competitive effect on oak growth and quality had not been studied yet. Aims: The aim of the study was to analyse the effects of inter- and intraspecific interactions on growth and quality of oaks grown in cluster plantings by quantifying the influence of neighbouring trees. In addition, we analysed whether the spatial position of oaks within groups (inner section or periphery) influenced their quality development. Methods: Using Hegyi's competition index, the influence of competition from intra- and interspecific trees from early, mid- and late-successional species, on diameter, height, slenderness and quality (length of branch-free bole) of 10- to 26-year-old oaks grown in cluster planting stands was quantified at seven sites in Baden-W\"urttemberg and Hessen, Germany. Results: In general, mid- and late-successional trees exerted a stronger competitive influence on growth of target oaks in clusters than the conspecific oaks and pioneer tree species. Oak quality development benefited from intraspecific competition, but self-pruning was not further promoted through additional interspecific competition. Within groups, inner oaks had a higher probability of developing into potential future crop trees than outer oaks. Conclusion: Our study showed that intra- and interspecific competition had different effects on target oak trees and that these effect differed between nest and group plantings. The development of naturally regenerated and planted trainer trees in group plantings should be monitored carefully and if necessary be controlled through thinning or pollarding. \textcopyright{} 2013 INRA and Springer-Verlag France.},

Here, we hypothesize that positive plant-soil interactions enhance biodiversity and functioning in a temperate forest. To do so, we tested the relationships between plant diversity (i.e., tree and herb species richness) and functions (i.e., coarse woody productivity and litterfall productivity), and soil diversity (i.e. bacterial, fungal and nema\- tode) and functions (i.e. soil nutrient and carbon stock), and their interrelationships in a temperate forest in northeast China. The positive relationship between diversity and functioning was predominant within plant and soil compartments, and hence, provide support to the niche complementarity effect. As such, the positive in\- terrelationships between the diversity of soil and plant compartments provide support to the positive plant-soil interactions. Tree species diversity was positively related with herb species diversity and coarse-woody pro\- ductivity. Importantly, tree species diversity had pronounced positive effect on soil biodiversity resulting in increased soil carbon stocks, indicating that tree species diversity effect matters for linking positive in\- terrelationships between plant and soil compartments of a temperate forest. This study shows that tree diversity effect is the main regulating biotic mechanism for linking the positive connections between plant and soil compartments of a temperate forest, and hence, the niche complementarity effect can enhance forest functioning through positive interactions on resource supply. We argue that linking the multiple key functions and diversity indices of forests can enhance our knowledge on the main influential factors and underlying ecological mechanisms.},

Long-term effects of forest density management on total aboveground C are not well understood, especially for precommercial thinning (PCT) implemented very early in stand development. To assess the climate change mitigation potential of PCT, as well as tradeoffs with climate change adaptation, we examined total aboveground C stores in a 54-year-old western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) precommercial thinning experiment to determine how different PCT treatments affect long-term aboveground C storage and distribution among pools. Four aboveground C pools (live overstory, live understory/mid-story, woody detritus, and forest floor) were measured and separated into C accumulated prior to initiation of the current stand (legacy C) and C accumulated by the current stand (non-legacy C). PCT had no influence on the total non-legacy aboveground C stores 54 years after treatment. Live tree C was nearly identical across densities due to much larger trees in low density treatments. Low density stands had more understory and mid-story C while unthinned plots had significantly more non-legacy woody detritus C than thinned stands. Legacy pools did not vary significantly with density, but made up a substantial proportion of aboveground C stores. We found that: (1) fifty-four years after PCT total aboveground C is similar across treatments, due primarily to the increase in mean tree C of trees grown at lower stand densities; (2) deadwood legacies from the pre-disturbance forest still play an important role in long-term C storage 62 years after current stand initiation, accounting for approximately 20\textendash 25\% of aboveground C stores; and (3) given enough time since early thinning, there is no trade-off between managing stands to promote individual tree growth and development of understory vegetation, and maximizing stand level accumulation of aboveground C over the long term. We infer that early PCT can be used to simultaneously achieve climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives, provided treatments are implemented early in stand development before canopy closure and the onset of intense intertree competition.},

We used a 54-year-old PCT study to test long-term effects of forest density and thinning schedules on stand yield and tree-level characteristics in even-aged western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) stands. The study has three target densities (494, 890, and 1680 trees.ha-1) crossed with three thinning schedules (target density achieved through one, two, or four entries). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear contrasts were used to test the effects of density and number of entries on tree- and stand-level attributes. Thinning before stand age 10 years leads to long-term constant yield (219.0-269.5 m3.ha-1; P \textbackslash textgreater 0.05) across the tested densities. We also found constant volume growth across stand densities during the most recent measurement interval (5.42-6.41 m3.ha-1.year-1; P \textbackslash textgreater 0.05). Number of entries did not affect any tree- or stand-level attribute.

A balanced study design included seven stand densities, and two shrub competition conditions at four locations in western Montana. This report covers 10 years of growth response. Treees were age 7 and 9 when the study was started. Crowns, stem diameters, heights, phenology, and mortality were measured at the outset of the study and 5 and 10 years later. Crown length, width, configuration, and volume of this intolerant species were sensitive to stand density \textendash{} the heavier the density the smaller the crowns in every dimension. Stem diameters were very sensitive to stand density but growth of crop trees \textendash{} was essentially the same when spaceings were wide and sites were not fully occupied. At narrow spacings, intertree competition distributed growth over the entire stand and average tree diameters declined. Height growth of crop trees was about the same on all stand densities except in unthinned stands where it was reduced about 15 percent. Densest stands produced the most basal area and volume but also the most mortality. Phenological timing was little affected by stand densitity. The removal of major shrubs at the beginning of the study had no significant effect on larch tree and stand development.},

The idea that decades of fire suppression have promoted unnatural fuel accumulation and subsequent unprecedentedly large, severe wildfires across western forests has been developed primarily from studies of dry ponderosa pine forests. However, this model is being applied uncritically across Rocky Mountain forests (e.g., in the Healthy Forests Restoration Act). We synthesize current research and summarize lessons learned from recent large wildfires (the Yellowstone, Rodeo-Chediski, and Hayman fires), which represent case studies of the potential effectiveness of fuel reduction across a range of major forest types. A "one size fits all" approach to reducing wildfire hazards in the Rocky Mountain region is unlikely to be effective and may produce collateral damage in some places.},

  abstract = {Wildfires across western North America have increased in number and size over the past three decades, and this trend will continue in response to further warming. As a consequence, the wildland-urban interface is projected to experience substantially higher risk of climate-driven fires in the coming decades. Although many plants, animals, and ecosystem services benefit from fire, it is unknown how ecosystems will respond to increased burning and warming. Policy and management have focused primarily on specified resilience approaches aimed at resistance to wildfire and restoration of areas burned by wildfire through fire suppression and fuels management. These strategies are inadequate to address a new era of western wildfires. In contrast, policies that promote adaptive resilience to wildfire, by which people and ecosystems adjust and reorganize in response to changing fire regimes to reduce future vulnerability, are needed. Key aspects of an adaptive resilience approach are (i) recognizing that fuels reduction cannot alter regional wildfire trends; (ii) targeting fuels reduction to increase adaptation by some ecosystems and residential communities to more frequent fire; (iii) actively managing more wild and prescribed fires with a range of severities; and (iv) incentivizing and planning residential development to withstand inevitable wildfire. These strategies represent a shift in policy and management from restoring ecosystems based on historical baselines to adapting to changing fire regimes and from unsustainable defense of the wildland-urban interface to developing fire-adapted communities. We propose an approach that accepts wildfire as an inevitable catalyst of change and that promotes adaptive responses by ecosystems and residential communities to more warming and wildfire.},

Although ecological change certainly occurred under the relatively stable conditions of the recent past, the nature of change under intensifying global change is different; it is unidirectional, and rapidly pushing beyond the bounds of historical variability. In the past, a manager could plausibly work to reverse or mitigate many stressors or their impacts to approximate pre-disturbance ecological conditions, but now accelerated warming, changing disturbance regimes, and extreme events associated with climate change reduce that potential. Indeed, even `holding the line' in the face of inexorable human-caused change is ever more difficult and costly. Thus, the convention of using baseline conditions to define goals for today's resource management is increasingly untenable, presenting practical and philosophical challenges for managers. As formerly familiar ecological conditions continue to change, bringing novelty, surprise, and uncertainty, natural resource managers require a new, shared approach to make conservation decisions. How, for example, should a manager respond to projections of loss of the Joshua tree from much of its current range, or to the emergence of new and different vegetation communities after a large fire event? The RAD (Resist-Accept-Direct) decision framework has emerged over the past decade as a simple tool that captures the entire decision space for responding to ecosystems facing the potential for rapid, irreversible ecological change. It assists managers in making informed, purposeful choices about how to respond to the trajectory of change, and moreover, provides a straightforward approach to support resource managers in collaborating at larger scales across jurisdictions, which today is more urgent than ever.}

Inventory data from the oldest 11 trials (5 or 6 years after planting) showed that initial spacing strongly influenced early growth of coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii). Average height and diameter at breast height were progressively larger as planting density increased; at the widest spacing (lowest stand density), average height was 75\% and average diameter at breast height was 67\% of that at the closest spacing. We have no firm explanation for the early faster tree growth at close spacings. Trees planted at 2960 trees/ha (1200 trees/acre) attained breast height (1.3 m) 2 years earlier than trees planted at a density of 300/ha (120/acre).

Links among existing mathematical models of fire behavior are used to develop two indices of crown fire hazard-the Torching Index and Crowning Index. These indices can be used to ordinate different forest stands by their relative susceptibility to crown fire and to compare the effectiveness of crown fire mitigation treatments. The coupled model was used to simulate the wide range of fire behavior possible in a forest stand, from a low-intensity surface fire to a high-intensity active crown fire, for the purpose of comparing potential fire behavior. The hazard indices and behavior simulations incorporate the effects of surface fuel characteristics, dead and live fuel moistures (surface and crown), slope steepness, canopy base height, canopy bulk density, and wind reduction by the canopy. Example simulations are for western Montana Pinus ponderosa and Pinus contorta stands. Although some of the models presented here have had limited testing or restricted geographic applicability, the concepts will apply to models for other regions and new models with greater geographic applicability.},

Importantly, complementarity effects increased with both shade tolerance and phylogenetic dissimilarity between the focal tree and its neighbours.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in whether or not the intermediate representations offered by these modules may be used to explain the reasoning for a model's prediction, and consequently reach insights regarding the model's decision-making process. A recent paper claims that 'Attention is not Explanation' (Jain and Wallace, 2019). We challenge many of the assumptions underlying this work, arguing that such a claim depends on one's definition of explanation, and that testing it needs to take into account all elements of the model. We propose four alternative tests to determine when/whether attention can be used as explanation: a simple uniform-weights baseline; a variance calibration based on multiple random seed runs; a diagnostic framework using frozen weights from pretrained models; and an end-to-end adversarial attention training protocol. Each allows for meaningful interpretation of attention mechanisms in RNN models. We show that even when reliable adversarial distributions can be found, they don't perform well on the simple diagnostic, indicating that prior work does not disprove the usefulness of attention mechanisms for explainability.}

Quantitative models are frequently employed to tackle the complexities associated with disturbance processes. Here we review the wide variety of approaches to modelling natural disturbances in forest ecosystems, addressing the full spectrum of disturbance modelling from single events to integrated disturbance regimes. We applied a general, process-based framework founded in disturbance ecology to analyze modelling approaches for drought, wind, forest fires, insect pests and ungulate browsing. Modelling approaches were reviewed by disturbance agent and mechanism, and a set of general disturbance modelling concepts was deduced. We found that although the number of disturbance modelling approaches emerging over the last 15 years has increased strongly, statistical concepts for descriptive modelling are still largely prevalent over mechanistic concepts for explanatory and predictive applications. Yet, considering the increasing importance of disturbances for forest dynamics and ecosystem stewardship under anthropogenic climate change, the latter concepts are crucial tool for understanding and coping with change in forest ecosystems. Current challenges for disturbance modelling in forest ecosystems are thus (i) to overcome remaining limits in process understanding, (ii) to further a mechanistic foundation in disturbance modelling, (iii) to integrate multiple disturbance processes in dynamic ecosystem models for decision support in forest management, and (iv) to bring together scaling capabilities across several levels of organization with a representation of system complexity that captures the emergent behaviour of disturbance regimes. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Forest ecosystem dynamics emerges from nonlinear interactions between adaptive biotic agents (i.e., individual trees) and their relationship with a spatially and temporally heterogeneous abiotic environment. Understanding and predicting the dynamics resulting from these complex interactions is crucial for the sustainable stewardship of ecosystems, particularly in the context of rapidly changing environmental conditions. Here we present iLand (the individual-based forest landscape and disturbance model), a novel approach to simulating forest dynamics as an emergent property of environmental drivers, ecosystem processes and dynamic interactions across scales. Our specific objectives were (i) to describe the model, in particular its novel approach to simulate spatially explicit individual-tree competition for resources over large scales within a process-based framework of physiological resource use, and (ii) to present a suite of evaluation experiments assessing iLands ability to simulate tree growth and mortality for a wide range of forest ecosystems. Adopting an approach rooted in ecological field theory, iLand calculates a continuous field of light availability over the landscape, with every tree represented by a mechanistically derived, size- and species-dependent pattern of light interference. Within a hierarchical multi-scale framework productivity is derived at stand-level by means of a light-use efficiency approach, and downscaled to individuals via local light availability. Allocation (based on allometric ratios) and mortality (resulting from carbon starvation) are modeled at the individual-tree level, accounting for adaptive behavior of trees in response to their environment. To evaluate the model we conducted simulations over the extended environmental gradient of a longitudinal transect in Oregon, USA, and successfully compared results against independently observed productivity estimates (63.4\% of variation explained) and mortality patterns in even-aged stands. This transect experiment was furthermore replicated for a different set of species and ecosystems in the Austrian Alps, documenting the robustness and generality of our approach. Model performance was also successfully evaluated for structurally and compositionally complex old-growth forests in the western Cascades of Oregon. Finally, the ability of our approach to address forest ecosystem dynamics at landscape scales was demonstrated by a computational scaling experiment. In simulating the emergence of ecosystem patterns and dynamics as a result of complex process interactions across scales our approach has the potential to contribute crucial capacities to understanding and fostering forest ecosystem resilience under changing climatic conditions. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Disturbances are key drivers of forest ecosystem dynamics, and forests are well adapted to their natural disturbance regimes. However, as a result of climate change, disturbance frequency is expected to increase in the future in many regions. It is not yet clear how such changes might affect forest ecosystems, and which mechanisms contribute to (current and future) disturbance resilience. We studied a 6364-ha landscape in the western Cascades of Oregon, USA, to investigate how patches of remnant old-growth trees (as one important class of biological legacies) affect the resilience of forest ecosystems to disturbance. Using the spatially explicit, individual-based, forest landscape model iLand, we analyzed the effect of three different levels of remnant patches (0\%, 12\%, and 24\% of the landscape) on 500-year recovery trajectories after a large, high-severity wildfire. In addition, we evaluated how three different levels of fire frequency modulate the effects of initial legacies. We found that remnant live trees enhanced the recovery of total ecosystem carbon (TEC) stocks after disturbance, increased structural complexity of forest canopies, and facilitated the recolonization of late-seral species (LSS). Legacy effects were most persistent for indicators of species composition (still significant 500 years after disturbance), while TEC (i.e., a measure of ecosystem functioning) was least affected, with no significant differences among legacy scenarios after 236 years. Compounding disturbances were found to dampen legacy effects on all indicators, and higher initial legacy levels resulted in elevated fire severity in the second half of the study period. Overall, disturbance frequency had a stronger effect on ecosystem properties than the initial level of remnant old-growth trees. A doubling of the historically observed fire frequency to a mean fire return interval of 131 years reduced TEC by 10.5\% and lowered the presence of LSS on the landscape by 18.1\% on average, demonstrating that an increase in disturbance frequency (a potential climate change effect) may considerably alter the structure, composition, and functioning of forest landscapes. Our results indicate that live tree legacies are an important component of disturbance resilience, underlining the potential of retention forestry to address challenges in ecosystem management.},

Interactions can amplify or dampen disturbances, yet the direction and magnitude of future disturbance interactions are difficult to anticipate because underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We tested how variability in postfire forest development affects future susceptibility to bark beetle outbreaks, focusing on mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae) in forests regenerating from the large high-severity fires that affected Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming in 1988. We combined extensive field data on postfire tree regeneration with a well-tested simulation model to assess susceptibility to bark beetle outbreaks over 130 y of stand development. Despite originating from the same fire event, among-stand variation in forest structure was very high and remained considerable for over a century. Thus, simulated emergence of stands susceptible to bark beetles was not temporally synchronized but was protracted by several decades, compared with stand development from spatially homogeneous regeneration. Furthermore, because of fire-mediated variability in forest structure, the habitat connectivity required to support broad-scale outbreaks and amplifying cross-scale feedbacks did not develop until well into the second century after the initial burn. We conclude that variability in tree regeneration after disturbance can dampen and delay future disturbance by breaking spatiotemporal synchrony on the landscape. This highlights the importance of fostering landscape variability in the context of ecosystem management given changing disturbance regimes.},

Interactions between individual disturbance agents are a major component of disturbance regimes, yet how interactions contribute to their climate sensitivity remains largely unknown. Objectives: Here, our aim was to assess the climate sensitivity of disturbance interactions, focusing on wind and bark beetle disturbances. Methods: We developed a process-based model of bark beetle disturbance, integrated into the dynamic forest landscape model iLand (already including a detailed model of wind disturbance). We evaluated the integrated model against observations from three wind events and a subsequent bark beetle outbreak, affecting 530.2 ha (3.8 \%) of a mountain forest landscape in Austria between 2007 and 2014. Subsequently, we conducted a factorial experiment determining the effect of changes in climate variables on the area disturbed by wind and bark beetles separately and in combination. Results: iLand was well able to reproduce observations with regard to area, temporal sequence, and spatial pattern of disturbance. The observed disturbance dynamics was strongly driven by interactions, with 64.3 \% of the area disturbed attributed to interaction effects. A +4 \textdegree C warming increased the disturbed area by +264.7 \% and the area-weighted mean patch size by +1794.3 \%. Interactions were found to have a ten times higher sensitivity to temperature changes than main effects, considerably amplifying the climate sensitivity of the disturbance regime. Conclusions: Disturbance interactions are a key component of the forest disturbance regime. Neglecting interaction effects can lead to a substantial underestimation of the climate change sensitivity of disturbance regimes.},

These models excel at detecting the functional form between two variables (often called trend), that is, whether trend exists, and if it does, what its shape is (e.g., linear and nonlinear). In many respects, however, these models are also an ideal vehicle for analyzing single-case designs because they can consider level, trend, variability, overlap, immediacy of effect, and phase consistency that single-case design researchers examine when interpreting a functional relation. We show how these models can be implemented in a wide variety of ways to test whether treatment is effective, whether cases differ from each other, whether treatment effects vary over cases, and whether trend varies over cases. We illustrate diagnostic statistics and graphs, and we discuss overdispersion of data in detail, with examples of quasibinomial models for overdispersed data, including how to compute dispersion and quasi-AIC fit indices in generalized additive models. We show how generalized additive mixed models can be used to estimate autoregressive models and random effects and discuss the limitations of the mixed models compared to generalized additive models. We provide extensive annotated syntax for doing all these analyses in the free computer program R.},

This model can be useful for estimating forest yield and biomass, and simulation of the vertical stand structures. Abstract: We developed a generalized nonlinear mixed-effects height\textendash diameter (H\textendash D) model applicable to Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and other conifer and broadleaved tree species using the modelling method that includes dummy variables accounting for species-specific height differences and random component accounting for within- and between-sample plot height differences and randomness in the data. We used two large datasets: the first set (model fitting dataset) originated from permanent research sample plots and second set (model-testing dataset) originated from the Czech national forest inventory (NFI) sample plots. The former dataset comprises 224 sample plots with 29,390 trees and the latter dataset comprises 14,903 sample plots with 382,540 trees, each representing wide variabilities of tree size, ecological zone, growth condition, stand structure and development stage, and management regime across the country. Among the four versatile growth functions evaluated as base functions with diameter at breast height (DBH) included as a single predictor, the Chapman-Richards function showed the most attractive fit statistics. This function was then extended through the integration of other predictor variables, which better describe the stand density (stand basal area), stand development and site quality (dominant height), competition (ratio of DBH to quadratic mean DBH), that would act as modifiers of the original parameters of the function. The mixed-effects H\textendash D model described a large part of the variations in the H\textendash D relationships (Radj2 = 0.9182; RMSE = 2.7786) without substantial trends in the residuals. Testing this model against model-testing dataset confirmed the model's high accuracy. The model may be used for estimating forest yield and biomass, and therefore will serve as an important tool for decision making in forestry.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that bark beetles and fires can be interacting disturbances, whereby bark beetle\textendash{} caused tree mortality can alter the risk and severity of subsequent wildland fires. However, there remains considerable uncertainty around the type and magnitude of the interaction between fires following bark beetle attacks, especially in drier forest types such as those dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson \& C. Lawson). We used a full factorial design across a range of factors thought to control bark beetle-fire interactions, including the temporal phase of the outbreak, level of mortality, and wind speed. We used a three-dimensional physics-based model, HIGRAD/FIRETEC, to simulate fire behavior in fuel beds representative of 60 field plots across five national forests in northern Arizona, USA. The plots were dominated by ponderosa pine, and encompassed a gradient of bark beetle\textendash{} caused mortality due to a mixture of both Ips and Dendroctonus species. Non-host species included two sprouting species, Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.) and alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana Steud.), as well as other junipers and pinyon pine (Pinus edulis Engelm.). The simulations explicitly accounted for the modifications of fuel mass and moisture distribution caused by bark beetle\textendash caused mortality. We first analyzed the influence of the outbreak phase, level of mortality, and wind speed on the severity of a subsequent fire, expressed as a function of live and dead canopy fuel consumption. We then computed a metric based on canopy fuel loss to characterize whether bark beetles and fire are linked disturbances and, if they are, if the linkage is antagonistic (net bark beetle and fire severity being less than if the two disturbances occurred independently) or synergistic (greater combined effects than independent disturbances). Both the severity of a subsequent fire and whether bark beetles and fire are linked disturbances depended on the outbreak phase of the bark beetle mortality and attack severity, as well as the fire weather (here, wind). Greater fire severity and synergistic interactions were generally associated with the ``red phase'' (when dead needles remain on trees). In contrast, during the ``gray phase'' (when dead needles had fallen to the ground), fire severity was either similar to, or less than, green-phase fires and interactions were generally antagonistic, but included both synergistic and neutral interactions. The simulations also revealed that the magnitude of the linkage between these two disturbances was smaller for fires occurring during high wind conditions, especially in the red phase. This complexity might be a reason for the contrasted or controversial perception of bark beetle-fire interactions reported in the literature, since both fire severity and the type and magnitude of the linkage can vary strongly among studies. These results suggest that, for fires burning in the gray phase following moderate levels of mortality, bark beetle\textendash caused mortality may buffer rather than exacerbate fire severity. However, for fires burning under high wind speeds, regardless of the outbreak phase or level of mortality, the near complete loss of canopy fuels may push this ecosystem into an alternative state dominated by sprouting species.},

We calibrated our model using a glasshouse dry-down experiment and tested it using in situ monitoring data on seedling mortality from reforestation efforts. We then simulated hydraulic stress and mortality in seedlings within the Bitterroot River watershed of Montana. We show that cumulative hydraulic stress, its legacy and its consequences for mortality are predictable and can be modeled at local to landscape scales. We demonstrate that topographic controls on the distribution and availability of water and energy drive spatial patterns of hydraulic stress. Low-elevation, south-facing, nonconvergent locations with limited upslope water subsidies experienced the highest rates of modeled mortality. Simulated mortality in seedlings from 2001 to 2015 correlated with the current distribution of forest cover near the lower treeline, suggesting that hydraulic stress limits recruitment and ultimately constrains the low-elevation extent of conifer forests within the region.},

  abstract = {A prevailing paradigm in forest ecology is that wood-boring beetles facilitate wood decay and carbon cycling, but empirical tests have yielded mixed results. We experimentally determined the effects of wood borers on fungal community assembly and wood decay within pine trunks in the southeastern United States. Pine trunks were made either beetle-accessible or inaccessible. Fungal communities were compared using culturing and high-throughput amplicon sequencing (HTAS) of DNA and RNA. Prior to beetle infestation, living pines had diverse fungal endophyte communities. Endophytes were displaced by beetle-associated fungi in beetle-accessible trees, whereas some endophytes persisted as saprotrophs in beetle-excluded trees. Beetles increased fungal diversity several fold. Over forty taxa of Ascomycota were significantly associated with beetles, but beetles were not consistently associated with any known wood-decaying fungi. Instead, increasing ambrosia beetle infestations caused reduced decay, consistent with previous in vitro experiments that showed beetle-associated fungi reduce decay rates by competing with decay fungi. No effect of bark-inhabiting beetles on decay was detected. Platypodines carried significantly more fungal taxa than scolytines. Molecular results were validated by synthetic and biological mock communities and were consistent across methodologies. RNA sequencing confirmed that beetle-associated fungi were biologically active in the wood. Metabarcode sequencing of the LSU/28S marker recovered important fungal symbionts that were missed by ITS2, though community-level effects were similar between markers. In contrast to the current paradigm, our results indicate ambrosia beetles introduce diverse fungal communities that do not extensively decay wood, but instead reduce decay rates by competing with wood decay fungi.},

Planting aspen seedlings grown from seed may provide a mechanism to improve restoration success and genetic diversity on severly disturbed sites. However, few studies have examined the use of container-grown aspen seedlings for restoration purposes from both the outplanting and nursery production perspective. Thus, the purpose of this novel study was to examin how alterations in irrigation levels during nursery production across three see3d sources would impact seeding performance attributes on harsh, dry outplanting sites. Irrigation treatments were based on three irrigation levels, determined gravimetrically: High = 90\%, Mediu = 80\%, and Low = 70\% of container capacity. The three seed sources represented a latitudinal gradient across th easpen range (New Mexico, Utah, and Alberta). Carbon isotope analysis indicated irrigation treatments were effective in creating higher levels of water stress for both the Low and Medium irrigation levels compared to seedlings under the High irrigation level. Seedlings subject to the Low irrigation level were found to induce greater height, higher photosynthetic rates, larger percentages of hydraulically active xylem, and faster xylem flow velocities compared ot the High irrigation level. The lack of an interaction between irrigation treatments and seed source for nearly all response variables suggests that nursery conditioning via irrigation limiations may be effective for a range of aspen seed sources.},

  abstract = {The fungus Elytroderma deformans causes a serious needle disease of pines in western North America and is considered the most important needle disease of ponderosa pine in Montana. While important, there has been limited evaluation of pre-commercial thinning or other treatments on disease incidence. Our study assessed the efficacy of various silvicultural treatments to reduce impacts from Elytroderma disease within monitoring plots that were established in 2004 and surveyed until 2014. Treatments were randomly assigned through incomplete block design to: (1) thin to 3.7 \texttimes{} 3.7 m spacing; (2) thin to 5.5 \texttimes{} 5.5 m spacing; (3) thin to 3.7 \texttimes{} 3.7 m spacing plus pruning; and (4) control with no thinning or pruning. For assessment, a statistic was developed to represent the average change in Elytroderma presence that occurred from 2006 to 2014 for each plot. This statistic was utilized as the response variable in a model that controlled for initial Elytroderma occurrence within plots to test for treatment effects. Overall, Elytroderma intensified across all plots during the study period and treatments were not effective at preventing new infections. Plots that received the 3.7 m \texttimes{} 3.7 m residual spacing exhibited slightly reduced progression of disease incidence relative to the other treatments. A mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, MPB) eruption occurred during this study. Tree-level MPB and Elytroderma interactions were assessed and no evidence was found to indicate trees infected with Elytroderma had a different likelihood of being attacked by MPB relative to uninfected trees. However, the trees located in plots with high levels of initial Elytroderma disease presence had greater chances of having tree mortality in general, caused by MPB or other factors. MPB did not attack any trees in plots that had the 5.5 \texttimes{} 5.5 m spaced treatment, even where adjacent plots were attacked. Results of this study are presented to inform management of young ponderosa pine forests on impacts of the silvicultural techniques tested on post-treatment Elytroderma dynamics and interactions with MPB-attack.},

General results of initially close spacings, with or without subsequent thinning, are well known (Evert 1971, 1973, 1984, Hamilton and Christie 1974, Sjolte-Jorgensen 1967), and interest in spacing is increasing. The high costs of stand establishment, limited markets for small trees, ability of technologists to make good use of fast-grown wood, inability to grow clear Douglas-fir except by pruning, and the premiums for large logs and trees have strengthened the view that wider spacings are economically preferable (Smith 1958, 1980, Smith and Kennedy 1983). To manage stands so that landowner's goals are achieved efficiently, forest managers must set target tree sizes for the products likely to be desired in the future. These tree sizes can be translated into desired numbers of trees per acre (or per ha), and thus into spacing. Fortunately, there can be flexibility in a manager's efforts to control stand development by numbers of trees, basal area, or average dbh. Targets established should allow efficient use of the resources available.},

The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the potential of thinning for improving tree performance during and after drought. We used results from 23 experiments that employed different thinning intensities including an unthinned control and focused on the response variables: radial growth, carbon- and oxygen-isotopes in tree-rings and pre-dawn leaf-water potential. We found that thinning effects on the growth response to drought differed between broadleaves and conifers, although these findings are based on few studies only in broadleaved forests. Thinning helped to mitigate growth reductions during drought in broadleaves, most likely via increases of soil water availability. In contrast, in conifers, comparable drought-related growth reductions and increases of water-use efficiency were observed in all treatments but thinning improved the post-drought recovery and resilience of radial growth. Results of meta-regression analysis indicate that benefits of both moderate and heavy thinning for growth performance following drought (recovery and resilience) decrease with time since the last intervention. Further, growth resistance during drought became smaller with stand age while the rate of growth recovery following drought increased over time irrespective of treatment. Heavy but not moderate thinning helped to avoid an age-related decline in medium-term growth resilience to drought. For both closed and very open stands, growth performance during drought improved with increasing site aridity but for the same stands growth recovery and resilience following drought was reduced with increasing site aridity. This synthesis of experiments from a wide geographical range has demonstrated that thinning, in particular heavy thinning, is a suitable approach to improve the growth response of remaining trees to drought in both conifers and broadleaves but the underlying processes differ and need to be considered.},

The bias occurs if the sampling errors differ between the calibration data and the prediction data. Differences arise from several sources. For example, plot designs often differ between two major applications of growth models: updating inventory statistics, and simulating effects of proposed nranagement actions. Even in a single analysis, not all data come from the same plot size, especially if plot designs vary by diameter classes. In addition, in growth modeling, plot-size to tree-slze relations change as the trees grow and management modifies spatial structure. However, if the sampling errors of the variables are used in estimating model coefficients, and again when the model is applied, the same model can be used with different plot designs. Local variation in stocking can be measured by individual subplots in tile context of a distibution of plots within the stand. When imbedded in a (semi-) distanceindependent, individual-tree model for stand development, the Structural-BasedPrediction method increases model sensitivity to competition compared to ordinary least squares estimates.

This study evaluated effects of severe, exogenous disturbance events, namely fire and beetles, on future fuel conditions through biannual field collections. We measured surface fuel deposition and accumulation rates for a number of forest types after severe wildfires, Douglas-fir beetle outbreaks, and mountain pine beetle outbreaks to quantitatively describe fuel dynamics for up to 10 years after the disturbance. Fuel deposition was measured from semi-annual collections of fallen biomass sorted into six fuel components (fallen foliage, twigs, branches, large branches, logs, and all other material) from a network of seven, one meter square litter traps established on 15 sites across the northern Rocky Mountains USA. We also measured fuel loadings of the same six fuel components on each plot every year until the end of the study. Results show that most foliage material fell within the first one to two years after disturbance and surface fuel loadings did not appear to increase substantially at any point during the 10 years of this study. Large woody material greater than 75 mm diameter was found infrequently in the litter traps. Our results suggest that there is little increase in fire hazard during the first 10 years after severe disturbance in the study sites sampled for this study.},

  abstract = {As the forestry landbase shrinks and demand for wood increases, improving productivity of commercial forest stands becomes more important. Because of its commercial value and common occurrence, lodgepole pine is a candidate for productivity improvement. Regenerating lodgepole pine forests are often characterized by very high density and slow growth, limiting their value. Therefore, a variety of precommercial thinning treatments have been tried at long- term installations, which provide valuable data to evaluate projections from existing growth and yield models. In this report, we evaluate the stand growth and yield from different thinning treatments in long-term silviculture installations in the Upper Foothills (Gregg Burn and Teepee Pole Creek) and Lower Foothills (MacKay) subregions of Alberta. The MacKay installation was established in 1954 with the objective of determining whether precommercial thinning of lodgepole pine could improve merchantable volume and quality at a young age, and in turn shorten rotation and increase annual allowable cuts. The Gregg Burn and Teepee Pole Creek installations were established in the 1960s to assess the response of tree and stand growth to different juvenile spacing treatments, with densities ranging from 500 to 8 000 stems per hectare. Tree growth and survival in these installations are measured periodically to evaluate the effect of different intensities of thinning on the growth and yield of the lodgepole pine crop trees. To provide a decadal update to previous measurements and evaluation, published in 2006, we examined total and merchantable volumes in these installations using the most recent data (2011\textendash 2014). Our analysis found that thinning is unlikely to increase yields; however, if thinning is carried out for other reasons, judicious choice of a thinning regime can avoid a yield loss. Thinning to 2 000\textendash 3 000 stems per hectare appears to be optimal, maximizing the positive effect on tree growth without major losses in volume.},

  abstract = {Acceleration of forest succession to develop late-seral structural characteristics in younger stands may be achieved by silvicultural practices such as pre-commercial thinning (PCT). Young second-growth stands of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) range across several million ha of the inland Pacific Northwest of North America and respond positively to various stand treatments. Objectives of this project were that large-scale stand thinning to a wide range of densities, at a 25-year period after PCT, would enhance: (1) productivity and structural features (diameter and height growth, and crown volume and dimensions of crop trees; (2) merchantable volume of crop trees; and (3) development of old-growth structural attributes. Three stands thinned to densities of {$\sim$}500 (low), {$\sim$}1000 (medium), and {$\sim$}2000 (high) stems/ha at age 17. years, with an unthinned young pine and old-growth pine stand for comparison, were located near Penticton in south-central British Columbia. Lodgepole pine grew faster in mean diameter (cm) in the low- (13.89) than either of the medium- (10.2) or high-density (9.2) stands, but mean height growth increment (8.8-9.7m) was similar over the 25-year period since PCT. Mean diameter was 2.2 times greater in the low-density stand than unthinned stand. The medium- and high-density stands also tended to have large diameters (1.7-1.9 times that of the unthinned stand) and crowns, but still with mean heights 5-6m less than trees in the pine component of the old-growth stand. Mean merchantable stand volume (m3/ha) was 1.7-1.9 times higher in the medium- (231) and high-density (257) stands than low-density (137) stand, and comparable to the old-growth pine (225). Mean crown volume (m3) of crop trees was substantially greater in the low- (88) than in the medium- (27) and high-density (31), unthinned (4), or old-growth stands (4 pine only). Mean structural diversity of five layers of coniferous trees was highest in the low- and medium-density stands, with declining diversity from the high-density to unthinned to old-growth stands. In terms of old-growth structural attributes, large dominant trees with substantial crowns, multi-layered canopies of conifers, some canopy gaps, and understory patchiness of herbs and shrubs appeared in the heavily thinned ({$\leq$}1000stems/ha) stands at 25years post-thinning. These stands were 42years old at this re-measurement, and hence were not considered "old-growth" but the heavily thinned stands seemed to have some old-growth structural attributes. Silvicultural trade-off of stand volume gain vs. old-growth attributes may be necessary for low-density stands.},

The diameters and diameter growth rates for the first 100 years of trees in the old-gowth stands were significantly greater than those in the young-growth stands. Growth rates in the old stands were comparable with those from long-term studies of young stands in which density is about 100\textendash 120 trees/ha; often young-growth stand density is well over 500 trees/ha. Ages of large trees in the old stands ranged from 100 to 420 years; ages in young stands varied by only about 5 to 10 years. Apparently, regeneration of old-growth stands on these sites occurred over a prolonged period, and trees grew at low density with little self-thinning; in contrast, after timber harvest, young stands may develop with high density of trees with similar ages and considerable self-thinning. The results suggest that thinning may be needed in dense young stands where the management objective is to speed development of old-growth characteristics.},

Future fire activity is projected to increase with climate change, but predictions are uncertain because humans can modulate or even override climatic effects on fire activity. Here we test the hypothesis that changes in socioecological systems from the Native American to the current period drove shifts in fire activity and modulated fire-climate relationships in the Sierra Nevada. We developed a 415-y record (1600-2015 CE) of fire activity by merging a tree-ring-based record of Sierra Nevada fire history with a 20th-century record based on annual area burned. Large shifts in the fire record corresponded with socioecological change, and not climate change, and socioecological conditions amplified and buffered fire response to climate. Fire activity was highest and fire-climate relationships were strongest after Native American depopulation - following mission establishment (ca. 1775 CE) - reduced the self-limiting effect of Native American burns on fire spread. With the Gold Rush and Euro-American settlement (ca. 1865 CE), fire activity declined, and the strong multidecadal relationship between temperature and fire decayed and then disappeared after implementation of fire suppression (ca. 1904 CE). The amplification and buffering of fire-climate relationships by humans underscores the need for parameterizing thresholds of human- vs. climate-driven fire activity to improve the skill and value of fire-climate models for addressing the increasing fire risk in California.},

The inclusion of the BAL index (which simultaneously indicates the relative position of a tree and stand density) into the base height-diameter models increased the accuracy of prediction for all species. On average, by including stand level attributes, root mean square values were reduced by 30.0 cm.

  abstract = {In the context of ongoing climatic warming, forest landscapes face increasing risk of conversion to non-forest vegetation through alteration of their fire regimes and their post-fire recovery dynamics. However, this pressure could be amplified or dampened, depending on how fire-driven changes to vegetation feed back to alter the extent or behaviour of subsequent fires. Here we develop a mathematical model to formalize understanding of how fire\textendash vegetation feedbacks and the time to forest recovery following high-severity (i.e. stand-replacing) fire affect the extent and stability of forest cover across landscapes facing altered fire regimes. We evaluate responses to increasing burn rates while varying the direction (negative vs. positive) of fire\textendash vegetation feedbacks under a continuum of values for feedback strength and post-fire recovery time. In doing so, we determine how interactions among these variables produce thresholds and tipping points in landscape responses to changing fire regimes. Where the early-seral vegetation was less fire-prone than older forests, negative feedbacks limited the reductions in forest cover in response to higher fire frequency or slower forest recovery. By contrast, positive feedbacks (more flammable early-seral vegetation) produced a tipping point beyond which increases in burn rates or a slowing of forest recovery drove extensive forest loss. With negative feedbacks, the rates of forest loss and expansion in response to variation in fire frequency were similar. However, where feedbacks were positive, the conversion from predominantly forested to non-forested conditions in response to increasing fire frequency was faster than the re-expansion of forest cover following a return to the initial burn rate. Strengthening the positive feedbacks increased this asymmetry. Synthesis. Our analyses elucidate how fire\textendash vegetation feedbacks and post-fire recovery rates interact to affect the trajectories and rates of landscape response to altered fire regimes. We illustrate the vulnerability of ecosystems with positive fire\textendash vegetation feedbacks to climate change-driven increases in fire activity, especially where post-fire recovery is slow. Although negative feedbacks initially provide resistance to forest loss with increasing burn rates, this resistance is eventually overwhelmed with sufficient increases to burn rates relative to recovery times.},

Here, we advance a detailed classification and high-resolution map of physiography, built by combining landforms and lithology (soil parent material) at multiple spatial scales. We used only relatively static abiotic variables (i.e., excluded climatic and biotic factors) to prevent confounding current ecological patterns and processes with enduring landscape features, and to make the physiographic classification more interpretable for climate adaptation planning. We generated novel spatial databases for 15 landform and 269 physiographic types across the conterminous United States of America. We examined their potential use by natural resource managers by placing them within a contemporary climate change adaptation framework, and found our physiographic databases could play key roles in four of seven general adaptation strategies. We also calculated correlations with common empirical measures of biodiversity to examine the degree to which the physiographic setting explains various aspects of current biodiversity patterns. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between landform diversity and measures of climate change to explore how changes may unfold across a geophysical template. We found landform types are particularly sensitive to spatial scale, and so we recommend using high-resolution datasets when possible, as well as generating metrics using multiple neighborhood sizes to both minimize and characterize potential unknown biases. We illustrate how our work can inform current strategies for climate change adaptation. The analytical framework and classification of landforms and parent material are easily extendable to other geographies and may be used to promote climate change adaptation in other settings.},

  abstract = {Currently, the temperate forest biome cools the earth's climate and dampens anthropogenic climate change. However, climate change will substantially alter forest dynamics in the future, affecting the climate regulation function of forests. Increasing natural disturbances can reduce carbon uptake and evaporative cooling, but at the same time increase the albedo of a landscape. Simultaneous changes in vegetation composition can mitigate disturbance impacts, but also influence climate regulation directly (e.g., via albedo changes). As a result of a number of interactive drivers (changes in climate, vegetation, and disturbance) and their simultaneous effects on climate-relevant processes (carbon exchange, albedo, latent heat flux) the future climate regulation function of forests remains highly uncertain. Here we address these complex interactions to assess the effect of future forest dynamics on the climate system. Our specific objectives were (1) to investigate the long-term interactions between changing vegetation composition and disturbance regimes under climate change, (2) to quantify the response of climate regulation to changes in forest dynamics, and (3) to identify the main drivers of the future influence of forests on the climate system. We investigated these issues using the individual-based forest landscape and disturbance model (iLand). Simulations were run over 200 yr for Kalkalpen National Park (Austria), assuming different future climate projections, and incorporating dynamically responding wind and bark beetle disturbances. To consistently assess the net effect on climate the simulated responses of carbon exchange, albedo, and latent heat flux were expressed as contributions to radiative forcing. We found that climate change increased disturbances (+27.7\% over 200 yr) and specifically bark beetle activity during the 21st century. However, negative feedbacks from a simultaneously changing tree species composition (+28.0\% broadleaved species) decreased disturbance activity in the long run (-10.1\%), mainly by reducing the host trees available for bark beetles. Climate change and the resulting future forest dynamics significantly reduced the climate regulation function of the landscape, increasing radiative forcing by up to +10.2\% on average over 200 yr. Overall, radiative forcing was most strongly driven by carbon exchange. We conclude that future changes in forest dynamics can cause amplifying climate feedbacks from temperate forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Key message: The mixture of Douglas-fir and European beech produced more biomass compared to what would have been expected from a weighted average of pure stands. Overyielding of the mixed stands improved with increasing stand age and under better site conditions. Context: The mixture of Douglas-fir and European beech has the intrinsic potential to be one of the most productive forest types in Central Europe. Aims: The study investigated how the structure and productivity of mixed stands changed in comparison to pure ones. It analyzed whether there is overyielding in mixed stands and if it was modified due to stand development or along an ecological gradient. Methods: Throughout Germany, 18 research plot triplets with 1987 trees were established in seven different ecological regions from dry to moist site conditions at ages 30 to 120 years. To investigate the growth of the stands, tree cores were collected from 1293 stems. Results: The study revealed significant overyielding of biomass in mixed stands of 6 \% or 0.81 Mg ha-1 year-1. It was found that: (i) Overyielding in mixed stands was driven by an increase in Douglas-fir growth. (ii) Both species modified their morphology in mixture. Compared to the species in pure stands, Douglas-fir diameters in mixed stands were significantly larger, whereas European beech had a smaller diameter at breast height in the mixture. The effect increased with the age. (iii) The analyses revealed more pronounced overyielding in older stands and on better sites. Conclusion: The findings show that overyielding of Douglas-fir and European beech in mixed stands results from a higher light interception by complementary space occupation.

  abstract = {Temporal and spatial scales of disturbance and recovery are often confounded in discussions of landscape equilibrium. We developed a broad framework for the description of landscapes that separates the spatial and temporal scales of disturbance and recovery and predicts the resultant dynamics of a landscape. Two key parameters representing time and space are used to describe potential disturbance dynamics. The temporal parameter, T, is the ratio of the disturbance interval (i.e., time between successive disturbance events) to the time required for a disturbed site to recover to a mature stage. The spatial parameter, S, is the ratio of the size of the disturbance to the size of the landscape. The use of ratios in both parameters permits the comparison of landscapes across a range of spatial and temporal scales. A simple simulation model was developed to explore the implications of various combinations of S and T. For any single simulation, disturbances of a fixed size are imposed at random locations on a gridded landscape at specified intervals. Disturbed sites recover deterministically through succession. Where disturbance interval is long relative to recovery time and a small proportion of the landscape is affected, the system is stable and exhibits low variance over time (e.g., northeastern hardwood forests). These are traditional "equilibrium" systems. Where disturbance interval is comparable to recovery interval and a large proportion of the landscape is affected, the system is stable but exhibits large variance (e.g., subalpine forests in Yellowstone Park). Where disturbance interval becomes much shorter than recovery time and a large proportion of the landscape is affected, the system may become unstable and shift into a different trajectory (e.g., arid ecosystems with altered fire regimes). This framework permits the prediction of disturbance conditions that lead to qualitatively different landscape dynamics and demonstrates the scale-dependent nature of concepts of landscape equilibrium. \textcopyright{} 1993 SPB Academic Publishing by.},

  abstract = {Crown fires create broad-scale patterns in vegetation by producing a patch mosaic of stand age classes, but the spread and behavior of crown fires also may be constrained by spatial patterns in terrain and fuels across the landscape. In this review, we address the implications of landscape heterogeneity for crown fire behavior and the ecological effects of crown fires over large areas. We suggest that fine-scale mechanisms of fire spread can be extrapolated to make broad-scale predictions of landscape pattern by coupling the knowledge obtained from mechanistic and empirical fire behavior models with spatially-explicit probabilistic models of fire spread. Climatic conditions exert a dominant control over crown fire behavior and spread, but topographic and physiographic features in the landscape and the spatial arrangement and types of fuels have a strong influence on fire spread, especially when burning conditions (e.g., fuel moisture and wind) are not extreme. General trends in crown fire regimes and stand age class distributions can be observed across continental, latitudinal, and elevational gradients. Crown fires are more frequent in regions having more frequent and/or severe droughts, and younger stands tend to dominate these landscapes. Landscapes dominated by crown fires appear to be nonequilibrium systems. This nonequilibrium condition presents a significant challenge to land managers, particularly when the implications of potential changes in the global climate are considered. Potential changes in the global climate may alter not only the frequency of crown fires but also their severity. Crown fires rarely consume the entire forest, and the spatial heterogeneity of burn severity patterns creates a wide range of local effects and is likely to influence plant reestablishment as well as many other ecological processes. Increased knowledge of ecological processes at regional scales and the effects of landscape pattern on fire dynamics should provide insight into our understanding of the behavior and consequences of crown fires. \textcopyright{} 1994 SPB Academic Publishing bv.},

This paper synthesizes current understanding of disturbance with an emphasis on fundamental contributions to contemporary landscape and ecosystem ecology, then identifies future research priorities. Studies of disturbance led to insights about heterogeneity, scale, and thresholds in space and time and catalyzed new paradigms in ecology. Because they create vegetation patterns, disturbances also establish spatial patterns of many ecosystem processes on the landscape. Drivers of global change will produce new spatial patterns, altered disturbance regimes, novel trajectories of change, and surprises. Future disturbances will continue to provide valuable opportunities for studying pattern\textendash process interactions. Changing disturbance regimes will produce acute changes in ecosystems and ecosystem services over the short (years to decades) and long term (centuries and beyond). Future research should address questions related to (1) disturbances as catalysts of rapid ecological change, (2) interactions among disturbances, (3) relationships between disturbance and society, especially the intersection of land use and disturbance, and (4) feedbacks from disturbance to other global drivers. Ecologists should make a renewed and concerted effort to understand and anticipate the causes and consequences of changing disturbance regimes},

Fire intervals are projected to decline drastically as climate warms, and forests that reburn before recovering from previous fire may lose their ability to rebound. We studied recent fires in Greater Yellowstone (Wyoming, United States) and asked whether short-interval (\textbackslash textless30 years) stand-replacing fires can Erode lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forest resilience via increased burn severity, reduced early postfire tree regeneration, reduced carbon stocks, and slower carbon recovery. During 2016, fires reburned young lodgepole pine forests that regenerated after wildfires in 1988 and 2000. During 2017, we sampled 0.25-ha plots in stand-replacing reburns (n = 18) and nearby young forests that did not reburn (n = 9). We also simulated stand development with and without reburns to assess carbon recovery trajectories. Nearly all prefire biomass was combusted (``crown fire plus'') in some reburns in which prefire trees were dense and small ({$\leq$}4-cm basal diameter). Postfire tree seedling density was reduced sixfold relative to the previous (long-interval) fire, and high-density stands (\textbackslash textgreater40,000 stems ha-1) were converted to sparse stands (\textbackslash textless1,000 stems ha-1). In reburns, coarse wood biomass and aboveground carbon stocks were reduced by 65 and 62\%, respectively, relative to areas that did not reburn. Increased carbon loss plus sparse tree regeneration delayed simulated carbon recovery by \textbackslash textgreater150 years. Forests did not transition to nonforest, but extreme burn severity and reduced tree recovery foreshadow an erosion of forest resilience.},

The minimum light required for survival, shade tolerance, is a crucial life-history trait that plays a major role in plant community dynamics. There is consensus on the suites of traits that influence shade tolerance, but debate over the relative importance of traits maximizing photosynthetic carbon gain in low light versus those minimizing losses. Shade tolerance is influenced by plant ontogeny and by numerous biotic and abiotic factors. Although phenotypic plasticity tends to be low in shade-tolerant species (e.g., scant elongation in low light), plasticity for certain traits, particularly for morphological features optimizing light capture, can be high. Understanding differential competitive potentials among cooccurring species mediated by shade tolerance is critical to predict ecosystem responses to global change drivers such as elevated CO2, climate change and the spread of invasive species.

Is a mixed Norway spruce-silver fir stand more productive than pure adjacent stands of either species? How to develop generic modelling approaches to assess mixture effects in forest stands? Location: In addition to a case study on Norway spruce-silver fir stands in French mountain forests, the generic approach used goes beyond local applications. Methods: We took advantage of National Forest Inventory data to develop a unique stand basal-area-increment model for pure and mixed stands of Norway spruce and silver fir that responds to ecological site conditions. The database was made up of 284 pure Norway spruce stands, 196 pure silver fir stands, and 323 mixed stands of these species. Results: Pure silver fir basal area increment is strongly influenced by spring climatic conditions, whereas pure Norway spruce is more influenced by soil conditions. The mixture of these species has a positive effect on silver fir, which decreases as the proportion of fir increases. In contrast, the mixture has no noticeable effect on Norway spruce. Conclusion: We developed a stand basal-area-increment model evidencing an advantage of the mixture on silver fir basal area increment, but not on Norway spruce. The mathematical formulation of the model developed is generic and can be used in all two-species mixture situations. It also makes it possible to compare different mixture situations with each other. \textcopyright{} 2011 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

Studying how height growth is affected by species interactions can provide new insights on this issue. We studied the mixture effect on dominant height growth in order to answer two questions. Do species interactions in mixed forest modify the dominant height growth of species? Does the diversity effect on diameter found in previous studies correspond to actual overyielding, or rather to an effect on allocation of growth between diameter and height? We used the French National Forest Inventory (NFI) data to model the mixture effect on dominant height. We included biophysical factors in the models to compare the dominant height of mixed and monospecific stands, all other parameters being equal. We studied five target species \textendash{} Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl., Fagus sylvatica L., Picea abies (L.) Karst., Abies alba Mill., and Pinus sylvestris L. \textendash{} in association with sixteen other species. Mixture effects on dominant height were weak, though often significant. They were either positive or negative according to species association. We showed that mixture effect on dominant height corresponds to a leveling process between species: the taller one limits its growth while the smaller one's growth increases. Furthermore, most of the time, mixture effects on dominant height are in the same direction as those found on diameter, though with a lower magnitude. Our results confirm that tree diversity results in overyielding rather than in a different allocation of volume between the parts of the tree.},

Changes to growing season evapotranspiration correlated positively with changes in stand density, stand leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), while high incoming solar radiation during the summer months acted to amplify changes to evapotranspiration even given relatively minor changes to summer fPAR and LAI due to the rapid regeneration of understory vegetation. Lodgepole pine mortality from mountain pine beetle outbreaks showed lasting effects on stand-scale evapotranspiration which could have important implications for regional water resources.},

  abstract = {Forest trees exhibit a large variation in basal area increment, which depends on tree specific factors, inter-tree relations and the environment. Studying the effect of the above factors on tree growth is essential for forest ecology and forest management. In this study, a basal area increment model for 22 tree species of the Austrian National Forest Inventory was parameterized. The model included effects of tree size, competition, harvesting and disturbances, climate, soil, and species mixtures. The models were fitted using generalized additive models. Basal area increment increased with tree size for all species, and competition and density reduced tree growth. Shade-tolerant tree species showed a more pronounced decrease with competition, than light-demanding tree species. Tree growth increased with disturbance intensity, but confidence intervals for high disturbance intensities became larger. Many variants of the model that included climatic effects were tested, but the best variants used long-term-mean temperature and precipitation during the growing season and the positive and negative deviations thereof, which separated climatic site effects from temperature deviations due to yearly weather conditions. Several of the tested dryness indices were not able to explain tree growth from inventory data. Soil type and soil moisture were significant for many tree species, each of them accounting for a maximum of 10\% of difference in tree growth. Little growth was observed on calcareous Leptosols, whereas trees grew best on Planosols, on flysch or calcareous Cambisols. Growth was decreased on dry sites, but very moist and wet sites could result in either a decrease or an increase in growth, depending on the tree species. Mixture effects were significant for almost all mixtures with a sufficient number of observations in the data set. Notable exceptions were the mixtures of Pinus sylvestris L. with Picea abies (L.) Karst. and Abies alba Mill. and the mixtures of Quercus spp. with Pinus sylvestris L. and Fagus sylvatica L. Mixture effects were both favorable and adverse at individual tree level. Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica were two tree species, which were mainly favored by mixture effects. Interactions of mixture with age or site could not be modelled from the data because they were confounded with other effects of the inventory data. The new basal area increment model provided a comprehensive formulation, which can be use part of individual tree growth simulators and is easily transferable to other regions and environments and can be extended in the future.},

Climate warming and drying has led to more severe and frequent forest fires5\textendash 7, which threaten to shift the carbon balance of the boreal ecosystem from net accumulation to net loss1, resulting in a positive climate feedback8. This feedback will occur if organic-soil carbon that escaped burning in previous fires, termed `legacy carbon', combusts. Here we use soil radiocarbon dating to quantitatively assess legacy carbon loss in the 2014 wildfires in the Northwest Territories of Canada2. We found no evidence for the combustion of legacy carbon in forests that were older than the historic fire-return interval of northwestern boreal forests9. In forests that were in dry landscapes and less than 60 years old at the time of the fire, legacy carbon that had escaped burning in the previous fire cycle was combusted. We estimate that 0.34 million hectares of young forests (\textbackslash textless60 years) that burned in the 2014 fires could have experienced legacy carbon combustion. This implies a shift to a domain of carbon cycling in which these forests become a net source\textemdash instead of a sink\textemdash of carbon to the atmosphere over consecutive fires. As boreal wildfires continue to increase in size, frequency and intensity7, the area of young forests that experience legacy carbon combustion will probably increase and have a key role in shifting the boreal carbon balance.},

FVS-BGC couples the process model STAND-BGC to the empirically based forest vegetation simulator (FVS). We sought to determine whether the hybrid model could be expanded to simulate deciduous trees and their response to water stress, where to date the model has not been used beyond coniferous trees. FVS-BGC was parameterized with comprehensive ecophysiological, site, and silvicultural data collected on Acer rubrum L. (A. rubrum), Paulownia elongata (P. elongata), Quercus nuttallii (Q. nuttallii), and Quercus phellos (Q. phellos). Species-specific carbon gain and growth were simulated under well-watered and water-stressed conditions. Simulations on species-specific bases allowed assessment of drought effects on stand production and the ability to test FVS-BGC's capability to predict the water stress responses of deciduous species. Under well-watered conditions, FVS-BGC height and caliper predictions were not statistically different from measured values for P. elongata, Q. nuttallii and Q. phellos. Under water stress, FVS-BGC accurately predicted height and caliper in Q. nuttallii and Q. phellos. For carbon sequestration, FVS-BGC predictions agreed with measured values on all study species under well-watered and water-stressed conditions. In general, the simulations showed that modelled height, caliper, and carbon sequestration were consistent with observed data. This study establishes the potential for FVS-BGC applications to include deciduous species-specific simulations and their respective water stress responses. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) is a fast-growing, deciduous conifer that is often managed for timber production in the inland Northwest. No previous study has documented the response of this species to artificial pruning. Trees pruned as part ofa pruning cost study in 1992 were followed for 10 years to assess growth and epicormic sprout response. Trees were pruned to two heights: 2.4 and 5.5 m in three stands in western Montana. Epicormic sprouting occurred in a majority of trees in the first 2 years after pruning, but subsequently many sprouts died so that by year 10, only approximately 30\% oftrees had sprouts. Volume increment was adversely affected by more severe pruning among smaller trees pruned to the shorter lift. The volume increment of the trees that received the 5.5 m lift was generally unaffected, but trees receiving the 2.4 m lift were more sensitive to pruning. Initial tree diameter and residual crown length were important variables in predicting the 10-year volume increment in pruned trees. West.},

The PCT treatment significantly increased individual tree diameter at breast height (DBH), height growth, crown ratio, and crown width, while it reduced the tree height to DBH ratio. PCT also significantly increased stem taper and consequently, regional volume equations overpredicted observed stem volume by 2 to 15\%, particularly for the spaced trees. PCT also increased the number and maximum size of branches on the lower bole. The sizes of knots on half of the sampled spruce crop trees in the spaced plots precluded them from being used as select structural lumber; there were no other effects on log grade. Our findings indicate that PCT can have a long-term influence on the structural attributes of individual trees, and that improved stem-volume prediction equations are needed in the Acadian region of North America.},

  abstract = {The species self-thinning boundary line has been widely analyzed with a variety of statistical techniques. Most previous studies in the forestry literature have reported that the relationship does not differ across a range of stand and site factors, but these studies have primarily used statistical techniques that make model fitting subjective or interpretation of covariate significance difficult. There is growing evidence that the use of stochastic frontier analysis is an effective statistical means for objectively fitting the species self-thinning boundary line, offering the opportunity to test the influence of additional covariates. Using extensive even-aged coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii [Mirb.] Franco), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) data sets in the Pacific Northwest, we examined the assumption that the intercept and slope of the species self-thinning boundary line are insensitive to stand and site factors. Likelihood ratio tests indicated that site index, stand origin (natural versus planted), and purity (proportion of basal area in the primary species) significantly influenced the species self-thinning boundary line intercept for each of the species examined in this study. In Douglas-fir and western hemlock, the slope of the self-thinning boundary was also dependent on stand origin as well as site index in the case of Douglas-fir. Fertilization did not significantly influence the intercept or slope of the species self-thinning line for Douglas-fir and western hemlock. In addition, the inclusion of site aspect and dryness index marginally improved the red alder model of self-thinning, but neither site soil nor climatic variables improved the models for western hemlock and Douglas-fir. Thus, the species self-thinning boundary line can vary significantly among stands, and its variation is driven by several distinct factors; stochastic frontier analysis is an effective tool for identifying these factors.

Therefore, climate change adaptation strategies, such as assisted migration, have gained attention since 2007. Effective implementation of assisted migration can only occur if target transfer guidelines are developed because our current seed transfer guidelines, established to guide the movement of plant materials, lack inherent spatial and temporal dynamics associated with climate change. This limitation restrains reforestation practitioners from making decisions about assisted migration. Lack of operating procedures, uncertainties about future climate conditions, risks associated with moving plants outside their current ranges, and existing policies have hampered formal actions in forest management and conservation. We review the current thinking on assisted migration of forest tree species and provide information that could facilitate implementation. \textcopyright{} 2013 Society of American Foresters.},

Cardinal branch direction significantly influenced both SLA and horizontal leaf area distributions. Abstract: Leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), and their spatial distribution in the crown are important indicators of biological response to changes in growing conditions including light and water availability. Western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) is a deciduous coniferous pioneer species in the U.S. Inland Northwest known for its rapid growth, high-quality wood, and ecological importance. Analysis with nonlinear models revealed that SLA and horizontal leaf area distributions differ between cardinal quadrants of juvenile western larch crowns. SLA was significantly higher in the more illuminated, southern side of the crown, and leaf area peaked closer to the stem in the southwest quadrant. Similar to other conifers, horizontal distributions of foliage in western larch also shifted further outward towards the branch tips with increasing depth in the crown. Models developed for horizontal distribution of leaf area and spatial distribution of specific leaf area for western larch may be extended by future researchers to predict its response to environmental variables or management practices.},

  abstract = {Concerns about the fragmentation of Pacific Northwest forests are based on the assumption that these landscapes historically contained large, contiguous patches of old growth. However, this supposition appears to conflict with disturbance history research, which shows that wildfire was an important component of pre-settlement forest ecosystems. To better quantify historical forest patterns, a spatial simulation model of wildfire and forest succession was used to simulate pre-settlement landscape dynamics in the Oregon Coast Range, U.S.A. The model was parameterized to simulate fire regimes over 1000 years prior to Euro-American settlement using data from paleoecological, dendroecological, and historical sources. A simple fire-spread algorithm produced mosaics of variable fire severity and allowed simulated fires to be calibrated to match the shapes of real fires. The simulated landscape was spatially heterogeneous and highly dynamic. Old growth was the dominant patch type occupying a median of 42\% of the total area. The relatively long fire return intervals, highly skewed fire size distributions, and mixed severities characteristic of the historical fire regime generated a landscape mosaic with large (\textbackslash textgreater 100 000 ha) patches of old-growth forest, although smaller patches (\textbackslash textless100 ha) were the most numerically abundant. Both small and large patches of old forest have important ecological roles in a dynamic ecosystem, and future landscape management efforts should consider the implications of altering these historical patterns.}

Four species were sampled: ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), western larch (Larix occidentalis), interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia). Ratios of 80:1 (both measures in equal units) provided a stability threshold for all four species. Trees with higher ratios were more prone to damage than trees with lower ratios. Height:diameter ratios from trees grown in spacing trials were used to examine spacings that avoided development of unstable trees. Wide spacings or early thinnings provide the best means of avoiding major losses to snow and wind damage.

In addition, it possesses desirable statistical properties such as homogeneous residual variance, minimal multicollinearity, and linear parameters. The model is validated against independent data from two sources: a research study of young managed stands (2,881 trees) and a collection of long-term permanent research plots (6,594 trees). Predictions for small suppressed trees from the permanent plots are generally too large, but there are no significant relationships between residuals and other predictor variables in either data set. An unusual feature of the model is the intentional omission of site index and age, which is motivated by the large number of irregular stands in the reg/on.

Because wildfire is a key driver of terrestrial carbon cycling, increasing fire activity in these ecosystems would likely have global implications. To anticipate potential spatiotemporal variability in fire-regime shifts, we modeled the spatially explicit 30-yr probability of fire occurrence as a function of climate and landscape features (i.e. vegetation and topography) across Alaska. Boosted regression tree (BRT) models captured the spatial distribution of fire across boreal forest and tundra ecoregions (AUC from 0.63\textendash 0.78 and Pearson correlations between predicted and observed data from 0.54\textendash 0.71), highlighting summer temperature and annual moisture availability as the most influential controls of historical fire regimes. Modeled fire\textendash climate relationships revealed distinct thresholds to fire occurrence, with a nonlinear increase in the probability of fire above an average July temperature of 13.4\textdegree C and below an annual moisture availability (i.e. P-PET) of approximately 150 mm. To anticipate potential fire-regime responses to 21st-century climate change, we informed our BRTs with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate projections under the RCP 6.0 scenario. Based on these projected climatic changes alone (i.e. not accounting for potential changes in vegetation), our results suggest an increasing probability of wildfire in Alaskan boreal forest and tundra ecosystems, but of varying magnitude across space and throughout the 21st century. Regions with historically low flammability, including tundra and the forest\textendash tundra boundary, are particularly vulnerable to climatically induced changes in fire activity, with up to a fourfold increase in the 30-yr probability of fire occurrence by 2100. Our results underscore the climatic potential for novel fire regimes to develop in these ecosystems, relative to the past 6000\textendash 35 000 yr, and spatial variability in the vulnerability of wildfire regimes and associated ecological processes to 21st-century climate change.},

Intraspecific trait variation and genome duplication are common in plant species and can drive eco-evolutionary dynamics through genotype-mediated plant\textendash plant interactions. However, few studies have examined how species-wide intraspecific variation may alter interactions between neighboring plants. We investigate how subspecies and ploidy variation in a genetically diverse species, big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), can alter the demographic outcomes of plant interactions. Using a replicated, long-term common garden experiment that represents range-wide diversity of A. tridentata, we ask how intraspecific variation, environment, and stand age mediate neighbor effects on plant growth and survival. Spatially explicit models revealed that ploidy variation and subspecies identity can mediate plant\textendash plant interactions but that the effect size varied in time and across experimental sites. We found that demographic impacts of neighbor effects were strongest during early stages of stand development and in sites with greater growth rates. Within subspecies, tetraploid populations showed greater tolerance to neighbor crowding compared to their diploid variants. Our findings provide evidence that intraspecific variation related to genome size and subspecies identity impacts spatial demography in a genetically diverse plant species. Accounting for intraspecific variation in studies of conspecific density dependence will improve our understanding of how local populations will respond to novel genotypes and biotic interaction regimes. As introduction of novel genotypes into local populations becomes more common, quantifying demographic processes in genetically diverse populations will help predict long-term consequences of plant\textendash plant interactions.},

  abstract = {Alternative methods have been used for developing tree basic and generalized height-diameter models, including non-linear least-squares regression, non-linear mixed-effects method, quantile regression (QR) and a generalized additive model (GAM). However, these approaches have not been thoroughly compared. The purpose of this study was to compare these methods applied to tree height-diameter models for larch plantations in northern and northeastern China. The data were obtained from an extensive database curated by the China National Forest Inventory (NFI) that covers a wide distribution and range of stand conditions, including 5684 paired heights and diameters in 342 plots. Random effects at the Province, species and plot levels, and a combination of Province and species into the basic and generalized H-D models were incorporated. This study demonstrated that the mixed-effects basic model provided the best performance for model fitting and validation; QR could represent variable H-D relationships at different quantiles and the GAM was a suitable alternative for flexible modelling of the H-D relationship, especially for generalized H-D model. This finding indicates that the mixed-effects basic model does not require additional variables and is an adequate tool for generating missing height measurements for larch plantations in northern and northeastern China.}

  abstract = {Using stand density along with mean diameter to predict average height increases the proportion of explained variance. This result, obtained from permanent plots established in a loblolly pine plantation thinned to different levels, makes sense. We know that due to competition, trees with the same diameter are taller in denser stands. Diameter and density are not only necessary, but may be sufficient for determining tree height because other factors affecting height are reflected by diameter and density. In the process of developing the proposed model we found that height increases monotonically with density and that this increase is not bounded by an asymptote. Contrary to our expectations, the inclusion of density did not bring the allometric parameter of diameter closer to the theoretical value of 2/3. - See more at: http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/4900/\#sthash.rY7r1fri.dpuf}

  abstract = {Although there is ample support for positive species richness-productivity relationships in planted grassland experiments, a recent 48-site study found no diversity-productivity relationship (DPR) in herbaceous communities. Thus, debate persists about diversity effects in natural versus planted systems. Additionally, current knowledge is weak regarding the influence of evenness on the DPRs, how DPRs are affected by the variation in life-history traits among constituent species in polycultures and how DPRs differ among biomes. The impacts of these factors on DPRs in forest ecosystems are even more poorly understood. We performed a meta-analysis of 54 studies to reconcile DPRs in forest ecosystems. We quantified the net diversity effect as log effect size [ln(ES)], the log ratio of the productivity in polycultures to the average of those in monocultures within the same type of mixture, site condition and stand age of each study. The first use of a boosted regression tree model in meta-analysis, a useful method to partition the effects of multiple predictors rather than relying on vote-counting of individual studies, unveiled the relative influences of individual predictors. Global average ln(ES) was 0.2128, indicating 23.7\% higher productivity in polycultures than monocultures. The final model explained 21\% of the variation in ln(ES). The predictors that substantially accounted for the explained variation included evenness (34\%), heterogeneity of shade tolerance (29\%), richness (13\%) and stand age (15\%). In contrast, heterogeneity of nitrogen fixation and growth habits, biome and stand origin (naturally established versus planted) contributed negligibly (each {$\leq$}4\%). Log effect size strongly increased with evenness from 0.6 to 1 and with richness from 2 to 6. Furthermore, it was higher with heterogeneity of shade tolerance and generally increased with stand age. Synthesis. Our analysis is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the critical role of species evenness, richness and the importance of contrasting traits in defining net diversity effects in forest polycultures. While testing the specific mechanisms is beyond the scope of our analysis, our results should motivate future studies to link richness, evenness, contrasting traits and life-history stage to the mechanisms that are expected to produce positive net biodiversity effects such as niche differentiation, facilitation and reduced Janzen-Connell effects. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Authors.

  abstract = {We analyzed 45 years of data collected from three ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex P. Lawson \& C. Lawson) levels-of-growing-stock installations in Oregon (OR) and northern California (CA), USA, to determine the effect of stand density regimes on stand productivity and mortality. We found that periodic annual increment (PAI) of diameter, basal area (BA), volume, and aboveground dry mass were significantly related to stand density index (SDI) and stand age at start of the period; the quadratic trends varied among sites. Precipitation departure from the normal for each period explained a significant amount of residual variation in all PAI variables except diameter. BA production did not change significantly as SDI exceeded 270 trees{$\cdot$}ha-1 at the OR sites and 320 trees{$\cdot$}ha-1 at the CA site. Stand productivity was the highest at Elliot Ranch (CA) and the least at Blue Mountains (OR). A similar trend held in growth efficiency under lower stand densities (SDI \textbackslash textless 600). Most of the mortality was caused by Dendroctonus bark beetles in stands that exceeded SDI of 500 trees{$\cdot$}ha-1. Limiting SDI was about 900 trees{$\cdot$}ha-1, although plots at Elliot Ranch reached much higher than that. The results demonstrate that silvicultural control of stand density can be a powerful tool for reducing bark beetle caused mortality without sacrificing stand productivity.},

  abstract = {A multilevel nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach is used to model loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stand volume growth in conjunction with four silvicultural treatments. Comparisons of treatment effects over time are integrated with the model-building process. Three-level random effects are introduced into a modified Richards growth model. Within-plot heterogeneity and correlation still occur, which are described by the exponential variance function and a first-order autoregressive model. The combination of complete vegetation control with fertilization results in the largest growth response; annual fertilization has the next largest growth response, with the exception that at very early stages the response is lower than that of vegetation control only; the control has the lowest growth response. The advantages of the multilevel nonlinear mixed effects model include its ability to handle unbalanced and incomplete repeated measures data, its flexibility to model multiple sources of heterogeneity and complex patterns of correlation, and its higher power to make treatment comparisons. We address in detail a general strategy of multilevel nonlinear mixed effects model building. \textcopyright{} 2005 NRC Canada.}

However, both are essential in enhancing the capability of statistical models. To this end, we establish simultaneous confidence corridors (SCCs) and a type of Bayesian information criterion (BIC) through the spline-backfitted kernel smoothing techniques proposed in recent articles. To characterize the global features of each non-parametric components, SCCs are constructed for testing their overall trends and entire shapes. By extending the BIC in additive models with identity/trivial link, an asymptotically consistent BIC approach for variable selection is built up in GAM to improve the parsimony of model without loss of prediction accuracy. Simulations and a real example corroborate the above findings.},
