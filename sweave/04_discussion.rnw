Additive models (e.g., GAMs) are becoming more prevalent in ecological research for 
various applications to aid in capturing and describing complex non-linear 
relationships that otherwise would require extensive testing to determine a 
suitable model form in parametric approaches \citep{Robinson2011,Adamec2015}. 
The model selection approach applied in this study produced a BAI model 
which resulted in relationships consistent with other empirical 
individual tree growth models. The effect of diameter on growth (shown in Fig. \ref{fig:basesmooths})
resembled the findings of \cite{Wykoff1990}, \cite{Monserud1996}, and 
\cite{Vospernik2021} such that growth increases rapidly at lower 
values of DBH and then tapers at high values. 
The effects of crown ratio were similar to those shown by 
\cite{Hann2003} and \cite{Wykoff1990}, as it is represented by 
a near-linear increasing effect (Fig. \ref{fig:basesmooths}) such that 
trees with longer crowns have enhance growth. The density 
effect of BAH was characterized with a decreasing effect approaching a negative 
limit (Fig. \ref{fig:basesmooths}), which is similar to that of \cite{Hann2003} 
(displayed in \cite{Weiskittel2011}). This is somewhat unsurprising given 
these studies strongly motivated the choice of variables considered here and 
that the PGP program is in the same region studied by \cite{Wykoff1990}. 

% Specifically, the smooths fitted for diameter, 
% crown ratio, and BAH are all consistent with well-established 
% functional relationships identified by \cite{Wykoff1990} and \cite{Monserud1996}. 

% -The diameter partial response curve is characterized by a sharp increasing

% BAI, but most interestingly, the shape of the fitted curve here is different 
% from those previously identified \cite{Stage1973b,Monserud1996,Hann1991,Vospernik2021}. 
%

% GAMMs were an invaluable tool in this study for estimating non-linear relationships and 
% dynamics that otherwise would have required more testing to determine 
% functional form. 

The way that site conditions were represented in the selected model, however, 
contrast from previous formulations, which often include 
information about slope, aspect, elevation, habitat, site index, and/or climatic data 
\citep{Weiskittel2009}. In this study, site effects on growth were only 
represented by aspect, potentially failing to account for other site differences. 
By only accounting for aspect differences, 
an implicit assumption is made that the effect of site on growth is constant 
regardless of slope or elevation. 
However, aspect was selected because it outperformed alternative measures, 
including a more comprehensive heatload metric that is based on a combination 
of slope, aspect, elevation, and incoming solar radiation \citep{Theobald2015}. 
Additionally, climate-based metrics derived at varying cartographic scales 
rely on their own set of assumptions. Of particular relevance is the cartographic 
scale at which a metric is calculated, where one must assume that microclimates 
and biophysical conditions are constant and that models estimating the variable 
are accurate. \cite{Stage2007} suggested that using a combination of slope, aspect, and elevation 
should improve prediction accuracy, which was observed here. However, the realized improvements 
were marginal and were associated with high concurvity values (> 0.8) among topographic 
variables as well as with BAH. Furthermore, the relative improvements to 
prediction accuracy realized by adding site variables was minimal, which is in line with previous 
findings \citep{Weiskittel2011}. Clearly there are tradeoffs associated 
with accounting for different site effects in this format, and future growth 
modelling efforts should consider these tradeoffs and how they may interact 
with modelling objectives. 

% (i) the estimated 
% value is generalizable across an entire area, (ii) microclimates are constant 
% across the scale-area, and (iii) that geophysical variation within an area , . 
% 
% One such assumption is that given a scale

% , particularly related to the scale at which 
% estimates are made which may not detect the influence of microclimate on growth. 
% 


Additionally, in contrast to the effects of BAL that were estimated in this study 
(displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:basesmooths}), others have identified an overall decreasing growth 
effect of BAL with higher rates of decreases in BAI at low 
values of BAL \citep{Monserud1996,Hann2003,Vospernik2021}. Of note, however, 
is that the present study implemented BAL as a ratio of plot BAH, similar to 
\cite{Stage1973b}, but dissimilar to \cite{Monserud1996} and \cite{Vospernik2021}, 
who implemented BAL as a quantity instead of a ratio (see \cite{Kiernan2008} for 
comparisons of BAL metrics). 
In the SPCt model presented in section \ref{basemodel}, BAL appears to have a 
marginal effect on BAI until it is in excess of 0.8 (Fig. \ref{fig:basesmooths}), 
meaning that western larch growth may not be 
particularly adversely affected by the presence of larger trees until there 
is a very large abundance of them. \cite{Vospernik2021} found that only including 
BAL as a competition measure was sufficient in capturing competitive effects 
across species. That option was excluded here because it was thought important 
to consider tree-level competitive effects (e.g., BAL) in addition to community 
crowding effects (e.g., BAH), especially since both have been shown to interact 
with species composition \citep{Brunner2020}. However, the individual predictor 
results reported at the end of Section \ref{basemodel} indicate that BAL is 
well-suited for growth prediction in western larch, which 
is in concurrence with \cite{Contreras2011}, who identified BAL to have a closer 
relationship with growth in larch than other distance-independent measures. 
Despite the individual performance of BAL, however, this study identified 
important effects of BAL and BAH in the same model, which is consistent with 
\cite{Wykoff1990}, \cite{Monserud1996}, and more recently \cite{Riofrio2019} and 
\cite{Vospernik2021}, whose applications were nonlinear and 
nonparametric modeling, respectively.

% 
% 
% The results reported at the end of 
% Section \ref{basemodel} agree with the findings of \cite{Contreras2011}, showing 
% that BAL is a strong predictor of growth in western larch. However, these findings 
% do not undermine that the results 
% in this study indicate that including both tree- and stand- level competition 
% indices is pertinent in the western larch growth 
% relationship, which is consistent with \cite{Wykoff1990}
% 
% these findings 
% do not undermine the fact that BAL, BAH, and CR together are a well-suited 
% combination of competition variables for growth estimation. 
%

% This highlights an advantage of using the GAM-based approach -

% effect on growth. 
% Along the same lines, however, 
% In contrast to such benefits

To realize the benefits of using a (non-parametric) smooth-based approach, 
however, one must ensure that a smooth has enough flexibility to capture complex 
functional forms, but that it does not capture \emph{too much} variability in 
observed scatter around those forms. The former requires setting the a sufficiently 
large limit of a smooth's EDF, which 
is defined by k-1, where k is the basis size, and one degree of freedom is 
used to ensure identifiability \citep{wood2006generalized}. The latter requires 
that a smoothing parameter is estimated such that it effectively maintains a 
smooth's variability \citep[see section \ref{gamoverview}; ][]{wood2006generalized,Pedersen2019}. 
In this study the choice of k was 10 for DBH , BAL, and BAH 
(10 is the default value provided by mgcv), which appeared appropriate given 
how each estimated smooth compared to previous studies (as discussed above). 
However, the variability shown at high values of BAH (> 50 $\mathrm{m^2/ha}$) 
in Fig. \ref{fig:basesmooths} highlight an instance where 
smoothing complexity could complicate interpretation. 
Although the BAH smooth was fit with high confidence as a non-zero effect, 
it also had a relatively high complexity 
(EDF > 8; Table \ref{tab:rmse}; Fig. \ref{fig:basesmooths}), given the basis dimension. 
In this case it doesn't challenge the interpretability 
of the BAH effect on growth, as there clearly is an overall decreasing 
effect, and it is known that growth tends to be limited in 
densely packed stands \citep{Reineke1933}. 
However, in other cases, such as the shade intolerance smooth in 
Fig. \ref{fig:ccf_pur_shd}, further constraints may be necessary for more 
accurate characterization and clearer interpretation. 
An additional consideration is the range and relative abundance of data informing each 
of these smooths. There were few data at both high densities and 
low shade-intolerance values, respectively, compared to the overall range of each. 
Given this, the adequacy of basis dimension choice should be further evaluated 
and more careful consideration should focus on determining 
whether variations in the smooth are a function of sample size, 
the range of conditions in the data, penalization, or some other influencing 
factor. 
% Such bias-variance tradeoffs when fitting GAMMs are discussed 
% in \cite{Pedersen2019}. 

% In addition to these considerations, 
% ensure that there is ample data to estimate a 
% relationship
% 
% 
% 
% In other cases, such as the shade intolerance smooth, 
% further constraints may be necessary to provide for a higher confidence in 
% interpretation.
% 
% 
% Although, by using the TPRS basis, 
% the degree of penalization is not necessarily selected through 
% specifying this parameter \citep{wood2006generalized}, a higher EDF 
% creates more space for a function to vary. 
% 
% In the case of BAH, 
% there clearly was a low amount of penalization and/or too high 
% of a basis dimension, shown by the smooth's wiggliness at high values. 
%   



% Over-fitting can occur if 
% 
% 
% the functional space of a smooth is to big, such as when a term is provided 
% with too many effective degrees of freedom (EDF), or (more-so) if it lacks the proper 
% penalization structure, allowing it to capture too much variability in a 
% relationship.

\section{Assessing species-mixing impacts on growth}

The mechanisms by which species interactions lead to modifications 
in productivity relate to how competitive dynamics among species 
can vary as a result of the different (complementing, conflicting, or neutral) 
ways that trees access and/or use resources \citep{Pretzsch2017a}. 
Mutualism occurs when two species benefit from each other in some way \citep{Stachowicz2001}, 
while competition among tree species occurs when each species accesses or 
uses the same resource \citep{Connell1983,Callaway1997}. Mutualism and competition 
among species have been used to explain forest development \citep{Oliver1996}, 
and more recently they have been applied to explain how species interactions 
can modify how different species grow and develop in mixtures. 
% One instance 
% is when competition among species is reduced as a result of a difference in 
% structural attributes, suc


Since western larch is known for its high growth efficiency and shade-intolerance 
\citep{Schmidt1976}, it was posited that limitations in light availability in 
mixtures with other light demanding species would increase competition and 
result in lower growth compared to pure larch conditions.
Similarly, it was believed that western larch growth would be 
increased in mixtures with species that don't require as much light to grow. 
This study didn't specifically evaluate competition for light, but rather identified 
stand conditions where it might be different. So whether competition itself varied 
and led to modified growth of western larch when 
mixed with either lodgepole pine or Douglas-fir was unclear. 
However, the results in section \ref{comparespp} provide evidence that the 
way that larch growth related to each predictor was different in each mixture 
(Table \ref{tab:diff} and Fig. \ref{fig:diffsmooths}). 


% Since only western larch was considered in 
% this study, conclusions about mutual species dynamics cannot be made from the 
% findings presented. 

% It would naive not to acknowledge that 
% competition for other resources (e.g., water, nutrients, etc.) occur 
% in western larch forests, however, 

%  However, differences 
% in the larch growth relationship were identified using the difference-smooth

% result of mixing larch and lodgepole pine was unclear in this study.
% 
% The competitive interactions among larch and lodgepole pine were explored 
% There was,
 

% The effects presented in section \ref{mixlp} may be explained 
% partially by the distribution of data in this mixture-type. 
% 
% Specifically, 

The DBH difference smooth shown in the left of Fig. \ref{fig:diffsmooths} displays a 
positive difference at values greater than 12 cm, meaning that larch in mixtures 
with lodgepole pine would have higher expected growth at those 
values than larch growing with other larch, holding all else constant. This 
directly contradicts the expectations for these conditions provided in 
Chapter \ref{introduction}. There must be an empirical basis for the positive difference 
displayed, but it also may be partially due to the average and maximum tree 
sizes in this mixture being substantially smaller than those of the reference 
level (see DBH in Table \ref{tab:mixsummary}). 
A visual comparison between the trends of pure larch and larch-lodgepole mixtures 
in Fig. \ref{fig:sumfig} (first and second rows, respectively) shows 
few observations of DBH greater than 20 cm in lodgepole-pine mixtures. 
As a result, the trend lines in the lodgepole pine mixtures in the second row 
of Fig. \ref{fig:sumfig} do not display the same reduced trend in growth shown 
in the relationships of other mixtures at higher diameters. Thus larger values 
of DBH in Fig. \ref{fig:diffsmooths} which show positive differences between the 
lodgepole pine mixtures and the pure larch smooth should be questioned, and 
interpretation at values larger than 20 cm is withheld completely. However, 
the negative difference at lower DBH values is in concurrence with the stated 
expectation, suggesting that smaller-diameter western larch trees mixed with 
shade intolerant lodgepole pine experience lower rates of growth than the same size trees 
growing primarily with other western larch, holding other variables constant. 

% Thus the positive differences shown at 
% \ref{fig:diffsmooths} DBH values greater than 20 cm are withheld from the viewing, 
% although such values were fit. 
% 
% Therefore in Figure \ref{fig:diffsmooths}, 
% the positive difference at values higher than 20 cm may not be subject to valid 
% interpretation because the smooth likely projects beyond the range of data in 
% lodgepole-pine mixtures, over-estimating the difference. 
% 



% fail to achieve the same declining rate of increase as those of the first row at values above 20 cm. 

% Considering the similar shade-tolerances 
% and fast growth exhibited for each of these species, as well as 
% 
% 
% the increasing 
% difference between lodgepole-mixed larch growth in \ref{fig:diffsmoooths} may 
% be indicative that light is the primary limiting factor for growth in smaller 
% western larch trees in mixtures with lodgepole pine whereas when size is larger, 
% below-ground resources, such as nitrogen, may be the primary limiting factor. 
% Without evaluating the growth relationship of lodgepole pine, however, I can't say 
% this with any certainty. 
% 
% This finding is consistent with 
% those of

%

% relationship most likely fails to account for the tapering increasing 
% effect that occurs when DBH is greater than 20 cm. Presumably, this explains 
% why at larger diameter values 
% 
% to 
% over-estimation. 

The results described in section \ref{mixlp} suggest that competitively dominant larch 
trees grow less when mixed with lodgepole pine and that non-competitively dominant
larch trees in the same mixtures grow more compared to larch growing in pure stands with the same 
values of BAL. Yet, since BAL was calculated as the proportion of plot basal 
area in trees larger than a subject as opposed to the absolute amount of the former, 
an issue of scale was created when comparing across mixtures in these data. 
For example, if comparing a BAL value of 0.25 
in a pure larch plot where the BAH is 40 $m^2/ha$, to a larch-lodgepole pine 
mixed plot where the BAH is 10 $m^2/ha$, the tree of interest is facing
10 $m^2/ha$ and 2.5 $m^2/ha$ worth of area occupied by larger trees, 
respectively. Thus, in this example the relative social position, although being 
proportionally equal, does not imply the same quantity of competition 
in larger trees, confounding the interpretation of BAL. This scaling issue is 
a known weakness of accounting for BAL as a proportion of plot basal area, 
but studies of alternative forms provide mixed results 
\citep{Weiskittel2011}. A related issue arises when considering the relative 
ranges of DBH values for both lodgepole 
pine mixtures and pure larch mixtures. Table \ref{tab:mixsummary} shows that the 
lodgepole pine data are of smaller trees (based on average and maximum DBH) than those of 
the pure data (as noted above). Therefore a competitively dominant larch 
(i.e., one with a low BAL) in a lodgepole mixture is likely smaller than one 
growing with other larch. Thus, BAL is also confounded with tree size in this 
comparison across conditions. However, BAL is still a useful measure of social 
competitive position within the model for estimating growth, given that all 
other variables (including BAH and DBH) are accounted for. 

% Therefore a negative difference in growth for a tree 
% with low BAL values is expected given the BAI-DBH relationship identified in 
% Figure \ref{fig:basesmooths}, which identifies that smaller western larch have 
% lower rates of growth.  However, it is still a valuable predictor within 
% the model since it uses a log-link function, implying 
% a multiplicative relationship across predictor values on the response. 
% Thus, BAL is a useful measure of social competitive position within the model for 
% estimating growth, given that all other variables are accounted for. 


In Douglas-fir mixtures, the differences from the reference conditions (see Fig. \ref{fig:diffsmooths}) 
were generally smaller than those of the lodgepole pine mixtures. 
The difference shown for BAH effects in Figure \ref{fig:diffsmooths} indicates that 
larch growth is impacted the same way when mixed with Douglas-fir as it is in pure 
larch conditions at densities below 25 $\mathrm{m^2/ha}$. At BAH values greater 
than 25 $\mathrm{m^2/ha}$, however, there is an increasingly negative effect on 
growth. Both lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir mixtures show a change from positive 
difference to negative difference near 25 $\mathrm{m^2/ha}$. Considering that 
the primary BAH effect (shown in Fig. \ref{fig:basesmooths}) is near its lower 
limit at 25 $\mathrm{m^2/ha}$, the negative growth differences for each mixture 
may simply just imply that resources are scarce, and that growth is limited. Thus 
there don't appear to be any complementing effects between western larch and 
Douglas-fir that lead to enhanced growth in western larch.

The lack of differences in larch growth across pure western larch and Douglas-fir 
mixtures may indicate that the resource-seeking or -use dynamics of larch 
and Douglas-fir are similar enough that western larch growth is unaffected until 
competition for resources increases. The shade tolerance of Douglas-fir 
has been found to vary depending on the moisture of a site, 
where on drier sites it may be more shade-intolerant \citep{Carter1992}.
It's also been found that the influences of climate and genetics may 
impact the shade tolerance of Douglas-fir \citep{Drever2001}. The differences in 
estimated aspect effects shown in Fig. \ref{fig:diffsmooths} indicate that western 
larch growth was negatively affected when mixed with Douglas-fir on 
northwest-facing aspects. Since west-facing aspects are generally warmer and drier than 
east-facing aspects, it's possible that Douglas-fir has more shade intolerant 
characteristics on these aspects. Additionally, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:aspel}, 
larch-Douglas-fir mixtures evaluated were primarily on NW-facing aspects. 
Provided that Douglas-fir has more shade-intolerant characteristics in drier sites, this may explain the 
lack of differences in western larch growth in mixtures with Douglas-fir. 
However, since the growth of Douglas-fir was not evaluated, further 
investigation of these shade-tolerance dynamics is required. 



% Although there is no 
% clear evidence of species-specific niche complementarity effects, these results do indicate that such dynamics may be at play. 
% 
% 
% 
% may be viewed by the interaction of resource availability, 
% acquisition of resources, and efficiency by which resources required for 
% growth are used by different species in a mixture \citep{Pretzsch2017a}.

% 
% 
% Competition for resources then may occur when a resource is limited, 
% 
% 
% Trees of different species at the same site may compete for resources 
% when sharing growing space, 
% 
% 
% 
% Thus, inter-tree competition for a particular resource 
% (e.g., light, water, soil nutrients) can be modified when 
% resource availability becomes limited or in excess, when trees have similar or different 
% acquisition methods, or when the efficiency of resource-use is 
% similar or different. S
% 
% Therefore, inter-species competition may be modified 
% if at one point in time two trees have comparable or differing strategies,

\section{Comparing CCF, purity, and shade intolerance}

Despite the lack of conclusive results in lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir mixtures, 
the addition of species-information proved useful in estimating the growth 
of western larch in this study. The relationships fit with both 
plot purity and shade intolerance metrics indicate that after accounting for 
other influential factors, western larch growth may be 
better characterized with a simple measure of proportional basal area than 
with CCF (Table \ref{tab:mixvarsrmse}). These findings are in line with the those of \cite{Dirnberger2017}, 
which found that species-proportional measures of 
composition were more reliable than crown-area based measures. 
Furthermore, assessing and characterizing species-mixing impacts 
is simpler if they aren't tied into a density-based measure like CCF. 
CCF simply does not provide any straight-forward interpretation of whether different 
species dynamics are at play, as it only represents crown area as a weighted density. 
A specific comparison of CCF effects on western larch growth between specific 
mixtures could show how CCF the CCF effect changes with mixture, however, that 
is beyond the scope of this study. Consequently, using measures which directly indicate specific 
mixing-characteristics (e.g., shade tolerance, species-specific weighted densities) 
is particularly useful, given the interplay among species-composition, density, 
and site productivity \citep{Kimsey2019,Weiskittel2009a,Huber2014}. 


Both shade intolerance and purity displayed 
relationships indicating that western larch growth may be positively 
impacted when growing with other species (Fig. \ref{fig:ccf_pur_shd}; Table \ref{tab:mixvarsrmse}), 
holding all other variables constant. Considering 
this, and in addition to the differences of smooths identified across mixtures 
in the competition variables (Table \ref{tab:diff}), competitive dynamics and species 
composition together likely play an important role in characterizing how western 
larch grows. The results in Table \ref{tab:mixvarsrmse} and Fig. \ref{fig:ccf_pur_shd} 
are similar to \cite{Searle2020}, who showed that 
increasing dissimilarity in shade tolerance led to higher 
individual tree growth, depending on the level of competition, demonstrating 
positive effects of niche complementarity. The findings in this study lack 
adequate data and design to determine whether niche complementarity specifically impacts 
western larch growth. However, the models fit do suggest that a relationship between 
larch growth and purity of larch or shade-tolerance heterogeneity 
exists. Others have attributed differences in productivity to shade-tolerance 
heterogeneity \citep{Weiskittel2009,Maguire2021}, but few have evaluated the use of a 
shade-tolerance metric in the estimation of tree growth. 
This study provides additional support for the use of a shade-tolerance metric in growth 
modeling, given its ease of use, availability, and relevance, suggested also by 
\cite{Russell2013}. 

\section{Other impliciations}

In terms of management, the information provided here may be useful when managing 
western larch in a multi-species setting. \cite{Crotteau2019} discusses 
initiating climate adaptation in western larch forests through 
various silvicultural treatments, all of which involve managing larch 
with other species. Understanding the mixing dynamics on larch 
growth may assist in developing such adaptive strategies to aid in selecting 
species-mixtures which promote the growth of western larch. 
In the case of managing jointly for biodiversity and timber value, increasing 
relative shade tolerance and/or diversity may optimize growth in western 
larch, but the growth of other species in the presence of fast-growing 
larch requires further investigation. Thus, in order to recommend optimal 
mixtures which promote the growth of western larch as well as other species 
while also maintaining favorable climate adaptive conditions, further 
investigation into western larch and the potential for an over-yielding 
effect \citep{Pretzsch2009} is required. 

% For example, two 
% strategies proposed by \cite{Crotteau2019} involve managing overstory western 
% larch with western white pine (\emph{Pinus montincola}). 


The \emph{Larix}-specific findings of this research add to the limited 
knowledge base that exists for species-mixing effects on larch worldwide. 
\cite{Vospernik2021} showed that \emph{L. decidua} mutually benefited in 
mixtures with shade-tolerant \emph{Picea abies}, and was negatively 
impacted by shade-intolerant \emph{Pinus cembra}, shade-tolerant 
\emph{Fagus sylvatica}, and intolerant \emph{Betula spp.}. \cite{Pretzsch2016} 
observed a positive mixture effect on stand density, where maximum stand density 
was increased when \emph{L. decidua} was growing with spruce. \cite{Zhang1999} 
showed that larch and \emph{Fraxinus spp.} heights mutually increased in mixtures together compared 
to pure stands of each. However, \cite{Xie2020} assessed the height-diameter 
relationship of \emph{L. olgensis} when mixed with 
\emph{Fraxinus spp.}, and found results inconsistent with \cite{Zhang1999}, 
concluding that the height-diameter relationship for larch may or may not be 
impacted by species-mixing effects. Given the limited information on 
species-mixing dynamics for \emph{Larix}, a literature review covering each 
\emph{Larix} species may be useful to identify next-steps 
to elucidate \emph{Larix occidentalis} (as well other species) growth and yield 
dynamics in mixed-species forests.

% They may also indicate that western larch has competitive 
% resource-use strategies, which likely depends on overall stand density. 
% The use of BAL in this model is supported by the findings of \cite{Contreras2011}, which 
% showed that BAL was highly correlated with BAI in western larch, compared to 
% other distance-independent measures. 

% This allowed for more accurate estimates, as BAL showed a large effect on growth estimates. 

% Of note, however, is that here a ratio of BAL to plot basal area was 
% used to represent this effect, similar to \cite{Stage1973b}. 

% These inconsistencies highlight that which was

% \cite{Johnston2019} showed that GAMs were effective in modeling tree growth 
% response across different levels of fire severity. \cite{Kemp2019} and 
% \cite{Povak2020} also demonstrated the use of GAM(M)s for evaluating post-fire 
% seedling establishment and regeneration. 

% Additionally, the raw data displayed nonlinear trends 
% with increasing dispersion, thus the choice of a gamma distribution and a 
% long-link function appears to be justified.  

% Further research is limited, or perhaps has been overlooked.

% Advances in forest ecology and statistics base 
% Between climatic uncertainty and the realization of numerous ecosystem values, 
% contemporary management of forest ecosystems has pointed towards realizing the 
% potential benefits of managing for biodiversity in mixed species stands \citep{}. 
% In recent years studies have shown that tree- and stand- level growth and 
% yield can differ between mixed-species stands and monospecific stands, 
% creating a modernly relevant area of study \citep{}. 
% 
% This is especially relevant 
% considering the prevalence of human influence on ecosystems across the 
% western portion of North America. 

% In this study, an individual tree growth model was specified using a 
% nonparametric approach to evaluate the complex dynamics that explain the 
% growth of western larch, including previously unidentified effects of 
% community composition. Variability in growth was captured by variations 
% in individual tree diameter, crown size, competitive position relative to 
% other trees, overall crowding, and site aspect. There was evidence 
% indicating that these variables' effect the growth of western larch differently 
% depending on the species composition-type that a western 
% larch grows in. Further, the results here indicate that including information 
% about the species surrounding a western larch tree can contribute to minor 
% improvements to individual tree growth estimation. 
% 
% These findings were not without limitations such as a lack of diverse species composition data, 
% computation time associated with fitting multivariate additive mixed models, 
% and challenges associated with interpreting non-linear functional relationships.
